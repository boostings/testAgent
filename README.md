Very, very, early and rushed version of a Hyperliquid-knowledgable model by using a combination of RAG and custom MCP tools with the Hyperliquid API. There's a lot of things that I plan on doing here, such as.

- Swapping the miniature Qwen model to GPT OSS-20b or another larger model with a better base-all-around knowledge. 
- Properly configuring the MCP toolkit to be called at the correct times, not just calling a tool based on the prompt.
- Getting more training data, such as Discord chats, tweets, and trading guides. 

Not quality work at all, but mainly using this for a school project that will eventually be integrated into my product.
