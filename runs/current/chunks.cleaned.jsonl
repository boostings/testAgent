Liquidity, user applications, and trading activity synergize on a unified platform that will ultimately house all of finance.\n###\n\nTechnical overview\n\nHyperliquid is a layer one blockchain (L1) written and optimized from first principles.\n\nHyperliquid uses a custom consensus algorithm called HyperBFT inspired by Hotstuff and its successors. Both the algorithm and networking stack are optimized from the ground up to support the unique demands of the L1.\n\nHyperliquid state execution is split into two broad components: HyperCore and the HyperEVM. HyperCore includes fully onchain perpetual futures and spot order books. Every order, cancel, trade, and liquidation happens transparently with one-block finality inherited from HyperBFT. HyperCore currently supports 200k orders / second, with throughput constantly improving as the node software is further optimized.\n\nThe HyperEVM brings the familiar general-purpose smart contract platform pioneered by Ethereum to the Hyperliquid blockchain. With the HyperEVM, the performant liquidity and financial primitives of HyperCore are available as permissionless building blocks for all users and builders. See the HyperEVM documentation section for more technical details.\n\n![](https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2356094849-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FyUdp569E6w18GdfqlGvJ%252Fuploads%252FPgVwhFtylBB2kaxhQtZz%252FStack.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Dfb5b86d0-95be-41bb-91d3-d08c8603c284&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=1bb66f75&sv=2)\n\n[NextCore contributors](/hyperliquid-docs/about-hyperliquid/core-contributors)\n\nLast updated 5 months ago", "doc_path": "/srv/shared/Models/hyperLiquidAgent/test/runs/dataset/hyperliquid-docs.md"}

[About Hyperliquid](/hyperliquid-docs)\n# Core contributors\n\nHyperliquid Labs is a core contributor supporting the growth of Hyperliquid, led by [Jeff](https://twitter.com/chameleon_jeff) and iliensinc, who are classmates from Harvard. Other members of the team are from Caltech and MIT and previously worked at Airtable, Citadel, Hudson River Trading, and Nuro.\n\nThe team used to do proprietary market making in crypto in 2020 and expanded into defi in the summer of 2022. Existing platforms were plagued with issues, such as poor market design, bad tech, and clunky UX. It was easy to make money trading on these protocols, but disappointing to see how far behind defi was compared to its centralized counterparts. The team set out to build a product that could solve these issues and provide users with a seamless trading experience.\n\nDesigning a performant decentralized L1 with an order book DEX built-in requires an intimate understanding of quantitative trading, cutting-edge blockchain technology, and clean UX, which the team is well-positioned to deliver. The team actively engages with and listens to the community; you are welcome to join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/hyperliquid) to ask questions and share feedback.\n\nLastly, Hyperliquid Labs is self-funded and has not taken any external capital, which allows the team to focus on building a product they believe in without external pressure.\n\n[PreviousAbout Hyperliquid](/hyperliquid-docs)[NextOnboarding](/hyperliquid-docs/onboarding)\n\nLast updated 5 months ago", "doc_path": "/srv/shared/Models/hyperLiquidAgent/test/runs/dataset/hyperliquid-docs_about-hyperliquid_core-contributors.md"}

E.g. `BTC = 0` on mainnet.\n\nSpot endpoints expect `10000 + spotInfo[\"index\"]` where `spotInfo` is the corresponding object in `spotMeta` that has the desired quote and base tokens.

For perpetuals `coin` is the name returned in the `meta` response. For Spot, coin should be `PURR/USDC` for PURR, and `@{index}` e.g. `@1` for all other spot tokens where index is the index of the spot pair in the `universe` field of the `spotMeta` response. For example, the spot index for HYPE on mainnet is `@107` because the token index of HYPE is 150 and the spot pair `@107` has tokens `[150, 0]`. Note that some assets may be remapped on user interfaces. For example, `BTC/USDC` on app.hyperliquid.xyz corresponds to `UBTC/USDC` on mainnet HyperCore. The L1 name on the [token details page](https://app.hyperliquid.xyz/explorer/token/0x8f254b963e8468305d409b33aa137c67) can be used to detect remappings.", "doc_path": "/srv/shared/Models/hyperLiquidAgent/test/runs/dataset/hyperliquid-docs_for-developers_api_info-endpoint.md"}

For example, previously signed actions can be replayed once the nonce set is pruned.\n###\n\nHyperliquid nonces\n\nEthereum's design does not work for an onchain order book. A market making strategy can send thousands of orders and cancels in a second. Requiring a precise ordering of inclusion on the blockchain will break any strategy.\n\nOn Hyperliquid, the 100 highest nonces are stored per address. Every new transaction must have nonce larger than the smallest nonce in this set and also never have been used before. Nonces are tracked per signer, which is the user address if signed with private key of the address, or the agent address if signed with an API wallet.\n\nNonces must be within `(T - 2 days, T + 1 day)`, where `T` is the unix millisecond timestamp on the block of the transaction.\n\nThe following steps may help port over an automated strategy from a centralized exchange:\n\n1. Use a API wallet per trading process. Note that nonces are stored per signer (i.e. private key), so separate subaccounts signed by the same API wallet will share the nonce tracker of the API wallet. It's recommended to use separate API wallets for different subaccounts.\n\n2. In each trading process, have a task that periodically batches order and cancel requests every 0.1 seconds. It is recommended to batch IOC and GTC orders separately from ALO orders because ALO order-only batches are prioritized by the validators.\n\n3. The trading logic tasks send orders and cancels to the batching task.\n\n4. For each batch of orders or cancels, fetch and increment an atomic counter that ensures a unique nonce for the address. The atomic counter can be fast-forwarded to current unix milliseconds if needed.\n\nThis structure is robust to out-of-order transactions within 2 seconds, which should be sufficient for an automated strategy geographically near an API server.", "doc_path": "/srv/shared/Models/hyperLiquidAgent/test/runs/dataset/hyperliquid-docs_for-developers_api_nonces-and-api-wallets.md"}

Therefore, it's recommended that each trading process or frontend session use a separate private key for signing. In particular, a single API wallet signing for a user, vault, or subaccount all share the same nonce set.\n\nIf users want to use multiple subaccounts in parallel, it would easier to generate two separate API wallets under the master account, and use one API wallet for each subaccount.

[For developers](/hyperliquid-docs/for-developers)\n  2. [API](/hyperliquid-docs/for-developers/api)\n# Optimizing latency\n\nThe following optimizations may help latency-sensitive traders:\n\n1. Run a non-validating node against a reliable peer, such as Hyper Foundation non-validator.\n\n2. Run node with `--disable-output-file-buffering` to get outputs as soon as blocks are executed\n\n3. Run node with sufficient machines specs, at least 32 logical cores and 500 MB/s disk throughput. Increasing cores can reduce latency because blocks will be faster to execute.\n\n4. Construct book and other exchange state locally using outputs from node, which has faster and more granular data than the API. See <https://github.com/hyperliquid-dex/order_book_server>[](https://github.com/hyperliquid-dex/order_book_server) for an example on how to build an order book on the same machine that is running a node.\n\n5. `--batch-by-block ` on the node will wait until the end of the block to write the data. The example order book server above uses this to simplify logic, but a further optimization could include turning the flag off and inferring block boundaries otherwise.\n\n6. Consider canceling pending orders by invalidating the nonce instead of spamming the cancelation action. This will save on user rate limits and have a guaranteed success rate if the nonce invalidation transaction lands first. A cheap transaction to use for nonce invalidation is `noop` with no additional fields.\n\n[PreviousRate limits and user limits](/hyperliquid-docs/for-developers/api/rate-limits-and-user-limits)[NextBridge2](/hyperliquid-docs/for-developers/api/bridge2)\n\nLast updated 22 days ago", "doc_path": "/srv/shared/Models/hyperLiquidAgent/test/runs/dataset/hyperliquid-docs_for-developers_api_optimizing-latency.md"}

For example, with an order value of 100 USDC, this requires a fill rate of 1%. Each address starts with an initial buffer of 10000 requests. When rate limited, an address is allowed one request every 10 seconds. Cancels have cumulative limit `min(limit + 100000, limit * 2)` where `limit` is the default limit for other actions. This way, hitting the address-based rate limit still allows open orders to be canceled. Note that this rate limit only applies to actions, not info requests.\n\nEach user has a default open order limit of 1000 plus one additional order for every 5M USDC of volume, capped at a total of 5000 open orders. When an order is placed with at least 1000 other open orders by the same user, it will be rejected if it is reduce-only or a trigger order.\n\nDuring high congestion, addresses are limited to use 2x their maker share percentage of the block space.

[For developers](/hyperliquid-docs/for-developers)\n  2. [API](/hyperliquid-docs/for-developers/api)\n# Signing\n\nIt is recommended to use an existing SDK instead of manually generating signatures. There are many potential ways in which signatures can be wrong. An incorrect signature results in recovering a different signer based on the signature and payload and results in one of the following errors: `\"L1 error: User or API Wallet 0x0123... does not exist.\"` `Must deposit before performing actions. User: 0x123...` where the returned address does not match the public address of the wallet you are signing with. The returned address also changes for different inputs. An incorrect signature does not indicate why it is incorrect which makes debugging more challenging. To debug this it is recommended to read through the Python SDK carefully and make sure the implementation matches exactly. If that doesn't work, add logging to find where the output diverges.\n\nSome common errors: 1\\. Not realizing that there are two signing schemes (the Python SDK methods are `sign_l1_action` vs `sign_user_signed_action`). 2\\. Not realizing that the order of fields matter for msgpack. 3\\. Issues with trailing zeroes on numbers. 4\\. Issues with upper case characters in address fields. It is recommended to lowercase any address before signing and sending. Sometimes the field is parsed as bytes, causing it to be lowercased automatically across the network. 5\\. Believing that the signature must be correct because calling recover signer locally results in the correct address. The payload for recover signer is constructed based on the action and does not necessarily match.\n\n[PreviousError responses](/hyperliquid-docs/for-developers/api/error-responses)[NextRate limits and user limits](/hyperliquid-docs/for-developers/api/rate-limits-and-user-limits)\n\nLast updated 3 months ago", "doc_path": "/srv/shared/Models/hyperLiquidAgent/test/runs/dataset/hyperliquid-docs_for-developers_api_signing.md"}

[For developers](/hyperliquid-docs/for-developers)\n# HyperEVM\n\nThe HyperEVM consists of EVM blocks built as part of Hyperliquid's execution, inheriting all security from HyperBFT consensus. HYPE is the native gas token on the HyperEVM. To move HYPE from HyperCore to HyperEVM, send HYPE to `0x2222222222222222222222222222222222222222`. See the instructions in [Native Transfers](/hyperliquid-docs/for-developers/hyperevm/hypercore-less-than-greater-than-hyperevm-transfers) for more details on how this works.\n\nNote that there are currently no official frontend components of the EVM. Users can build their own frontends or port over existing EVM applications. All interaction with the EVM happens through the JSON-RPC. For example, users can add the chain to their wallets by entering the RPC URL and chain ID. There is currently no websocket JSON-RPC support for the RPC at `rpc.hyperliquid.xyz/evm`but other RPC implementations may support it.\n\nThe HyperEVM uses the Cancun hardfork without blobs. In particular, EIP-1559 is enabled on the HyperEVM. Base fees are burned as usual, implemented in the standard way where the burned fees are removed from the total EVM supply. Unlike most other EVM chains, priority fees are also burned because the HyperEVM uses HyperBFT consensus. The burned priority fees are sent to the zero address's EVM balance.\n\nOn both mainnet and testnet, HYPE on the HyperEVM has 18 decimals.

[For developers](/hyperliquid-docs/for-developers)\n  2. [HyperEVM](/hyperliquid-docs/for-developers/hyperevm)\n# Dual-block architecture\n\nThe total HyperEVM throughput is split between small blocks produced at a fast rate and large blocks produced at a slower rate.\n\nThe primary motivation behind the dual-block architecture is to decouple block speed and block size when allocating throughput improvements. Users want faster blocks for lower time to confirmation. Builders want larger blocks to include larger transactions such as more complex contract deployments. Instead of a forced tradeoff, the dual-block system will allow simultaneous improvement along both axes.\n\nThe HyperEVM \"mempool\" is still onchain state with respect to the umbrella L1 execution, but is split into two independent mempools that source transactions for the two block types. The two block types are interleaved with a unique increasing sequence of EVM block numbers. The onchain mempool implementation accepts only the next 8 nonces for each address. Transactions older than 1 day old in the mempool are pruned.\n\nThe initial configuration is set conservatively, and throughput is expected to increase over successive technical upgrades. Fast block duration is set to 1 seconds with a 2M gas limit. Slow block duration is set to 1 minute with a 30M gas limit.\n\nMore precisely, in the definitions above, _block duration_ of `x` means that the first L1 block for each value of `l1_block_time % x` produces an EVM block.\n\nDevelopers can deploy larger contracts as follows:\n\n1. Submit action `{\"type\": \"evmUserModify\", \"usingBigBlocks\": true}` to direct HyperEVM transactions to big blocks instead of small blocks. Note that this user state flag is set on the HyperCore user level, and must be unset again to target small blocks. Like any action, this requires an existing Core user to send. Like any EOA, the deployer address can be converted to a Core user by receiving a Core asset such as USDC.\n\n2. Optionally use the JSON-RPC method `bigBlockGasPrice` in place of `gasPrice` to estimate base gas fee on the next big block.", "doc_path": "/srv/shared/Models/hyperLiquidAgent/test/runs/dataset/hyperliquid-docs_for-developers_hyperevm_dual-block-architecture.md"}

For example, to deploy an ERC20 contract for an existing Core spot asset, the system contract should have the entirety of the EVM spot supply equal to the max Core spot supply.

The deployer of the EVM contract must then verify their intention to link to the HyperCore token in one of two ways:\n\n1. If the EVM contract was deployed from an EOA, the EVM user can send an action using the nonce that was used to deploy the EVM contract.\n\n2. If the EVM contract was deployed by another contract (e.g. create2 via a multisig), the contract's first storage slot or slot at keccak256(\"HyperCore deployer\") must store the address of a finalizer user.\n\nTo finalize the link, the finalizer user sends the following action (note that this not nested in a spot deploy action). In the \"create\" case, the EVM deployer sends the action. In the \"firstStorageSlot\" or \"customStorageSlot\" case, the finalizer must match the value in the corresponding slot.", "doc_path": "/srv/shared/Models/hyperLiquidAgent/test/runs/dataset/hyperliquid-docs_for-developers_hyperevm_hypercore-less-than-greater-than-hyperevm-transfers.md"}

This data is written after committed blocks are verified by the node, and therefore has no additional trust assumptions compared to running the EVM RPC directly from the node itself.\n\nBuilders that wish to index the HyperEVM without running a node can use the S3 bucket: `aws s3 ls s3://hl-mainnet-evm-blocks/ --request-payer requester`.\n\nThere is a similar bucket `s3://hl-testnet-evm-blocks/` for testnet.\n\nBuilders interested in robustness can merge the two data sources, relying primarily on local data and falling back to S3 data.\n\nSome potential applications include a JSON-RPC server with custom rate limits, a HyperEVM block explorer, or other indexed services and tooling for builders.\n\nWhile the data is public for anyone to use, the requester must pay for data transfer costs. The filenames are predictably indexed by EVM block number, e.g. `s3://hl-mainnet-evm-blocks/0/6000/6123.rmp.lz4.` An indexer can copy block data from S3 on new HyperEVM blocks. The files are stored in MessagePack format and then compressed using LZ4.\n\nNote that testnet starts with directory `s3://hl-testnet-evm-blocks/18000000`and the earlier testnet RPC blocks were not backfilled.\n\nAn example can be found in the Python SDK: <https://github.com/hyperliquid-dex/hyperliquid-python-sdk/blob/master/examples/evm_block_indexer.py>[](https://github.com/hyperliquid-dex/hyperliquid-python-sdk/blob/master/examples/evm_block_indexer.py)\n\n[PreviousDual-block architecture](/hyperliquid-docs/for-developers/hyperevm/dual-block-architecture)[NextInteracting with HyperCore](/hyperliquid-docs/for-developers/hyperevm/interacting-with-hypercore)\n\nLast updated 3 months ago", "doc_path": "/srv/shared/Models/hyperLiquidAgent/test/runs/dataset/hyperliquid-docs_for-developers_hyperevm_raw-hyperevm-block-data.md"}

[HyperCore](/hyperliquid-docs/hypercore)\n# Multi-sig\n\nAdvanced Feature\n\nHyperCore supports native multi-sig actions. This allows multiple private keys to control a single account for additional security. Unlike other chains, multi-sig is available as a built-in primitive on HyperCore as opposed to relying on smart contracts.\n\nThe multi-sig workflow is described below:\n\n* To convert a user to a multi-sig user, the user sends a `ConvertToMultiSigUser` action with the authorized users and the minimum required number of authorized users required to sign an action. Authorized users must be existing users on Hyperliquid. Once a user has been converted into a multi-sig user, all its actions must be sent via multi-sig.\n\n* To send an action, each authorized user must sign a payload to produce a signature. A `MultiSig` action wraps around any normal action and includes a list of signatures from authorized users.\n\n* The `MutiSig` payload also contains the target multi-sig user and the authorized user who will ultimately send the `MultiSig` action to the blockchain. The sender of the final action is also known as the `leader` (transaction lead address) of the multi-sig action.\n\n* When a multi-sig action is sent, only the nonce set of the authorized user who sent the transaction is validated and updated.\n\n* Similarly to normal actions, the leader can also be an API wallet of an authorized user. In this case, the nonce of the API wallet is checked and updated.\n\n* A multi-sig user's set of authorized users and/or the threshold may be updated by sending a `MultiSig` action wrapping a`ConvertToMultiSigUser` action describing the new state.\n\n* A multi-sig user can be converted back to a normal user by sending a `ConvertToMultiSigUser` via multi-sig. In this case, the set of authorized users can be set to empty and conversion to normal user will be performed.\n\nMiscellaneous notes:\n\n* The leader (transaction lead address) must be an authorized user, not the multi-sig account", "doc_path": "/srv/shared/Models/hyperLiquidAgent/test/runs/dataset/hyperliquid-docs_hypercore_multi-sig.md"}

A user may be an authorized user for multiple multi-sig users. The maximum allowed number of authorized users for a given multi-sig user is 10.\n\nImportant for HyperEVM users: Converting a user to a multi-sig still leaves the HyperEVM user controllable by the original wallet. CoreWriter does not work for multi-sig users. In general, multi-sig users should not interact with the HyperEVM before or after conversion.\n\nSee the Python SDK for code examples.\n\n[PreviousFor vault depositors](/hyperliquid-docs/hypercore/vaults/for-vault-depositors)[NextHyperEVM](/hyperliquid-docs/hyperevm)\n\nLast updated 1 month ago", "doc_path": "/srv/shared/Models/hyperLiquidAgent/test/runs/dataset/hyperliquid-docs_hypercore_multi-sig.md"}

Margin checks happen on the opening of a new order, and again for the resting side at the matching of each order. This ensures that the margining system is consistent despite oracle price fluctuations after the resting order is placed.\n\nOne unique aspect of the Hyperliquid L1 is that the mempool and consensus logic are semantically aware of transactions that interact with HyperCore order books.

Just as USDC can be transferred between perps and spot accounts, HYPE can be transferred between spot and staking accounts.\n\nWithin the staking account, HYPE may be staked to any number of validators. Here and in other docs, _delegate_ and _stake_ are used interchangeably, as Hyperliquid only supports delegated proof of stake.\n\nEach validator has a self-delegation requirement of 10000 HYPE to become active. Once active, validators produce blocks and receive rewards proportional to their total delegated stake. Validators may charge a commission to their delegators. This commission cannot be increased unless the new commission is less than or equal to 1%. This prevents scenarios where a validator attracts a large amount of stake and then raises the commission significantly to take advantage of unaware stakers.\n\nDelegations to a particular validator have a lockup duration of 1 day. After this lockup, delegations may be partially or fully undelegated at any time. Undelegated balances instantly reflect in staking account balance.\n\nTransfers from spot account to staking account are instant. However, transfers from staking account to spot account have a 7 day unstaking queue. Most other proof of stake chains have a similar mechanism, which ensures that large-scale consensus attacks are penalized by slashing or social layer mechanisms. There is currently no automatic slashing implemented.\n\nAs an example, if you initiate a staking to spot transfer of 100 HYPE at 08:00:00 UTC on March 11 and a transfer of 50 HYPE at 09:00:00 UTC on March 12, the 100 HYPE transfer will be finalized at 08:00:01 UTC on March 18 and the 50 HYPE transfer will be finalized at 09:00:01 UTC on March 19.", "doc_path": "/srv/shared/Models/hyperLiquidAgent/test/runs/dataset/hyperliquid-docs_hypercore_staking.md"}

At 400M total HYPE staked, the yearly reward rate is approximately 2.37% per year. Staking rewards come from the future emissions reserve.\n\nRewards are accrued every minute and distributed to stakers every day. Rewards are redelegated automatically to the staked validator, i.e. compounded. Rewards are based on the minimum balance that a delegator has staked during each staking epoch (100k rounds, as explained below).", "doc_path": "/srv/shared/Models/hyperLiquidAgent/test/runs/dataset/hyperliquid-docs_hypercore_staking.md"}

Rewards are based on the minimum balance that a delegator has staked during each staking epoch (100k rounds, as explained below).\n###\n\nTechnical Details\n\nThe notion of a _quorum_ is essential to modern proof of stake consensus algorithms such as HyperBFT. A quorum is any set of validators that has more than ⅔ of the total stake in the network. The operating requirement of consensus is that a quorum of stake is honest (non-Byzantine). Therefore it is an essential responsibility of every staker to only delegate to trusted validators.\n\nHyperBFT consensus proceeds in _rounds_ , which is a fundamental discrete bundle of transactions along with signatures from a quorum of validators. Each _round_ may be _committed_ after certain conditions are met, after which it is sent to the execution state for processing. A key property of the consensus algorithm is that all honest nodes agree on the ordered list of committed rounds.\n\nRounds may result in a new execution state block. Execution blocks are indexed by a separate increasing counter called _height_. Height only increments on consensus rounds with at least one transaction.\n\nThe validator set evolves in epochs of 100k rounds, which is approximately 90 minutes on mainnet. The validators and consensus stakes are static for each staking epoch.\n\nValidators may vote to jail peers that do not respond with adequate latency or frequency to the consensus messages of the voter. Upon receiving a quorum of jail votes, a validator becomes _jailed_ and no longer participates in consensus. A jailed validator does not produce rewards for its delegators. A validator may unjail themselves by diagnosing and fixing the causes, subject to onchain unjailing rate limits. Note that jailing is not the same slashing, which is reserved for provably malicious behavior such as double-signing blocks at the same round.\n\n[PreviousOrder book](/hyperliquid-docs/hypercore/order-book)[NextVaults](/hyperliquid-docs/hypercore/vaults)\n\nLast updated 5 minutes ago", "doc_path": "/srv/shared/Models/hyperLiquidAgent/test/runs/dataset/hyperliquid-docs_hypercore_staking.md"}

Visit the [HyperEVM onboarding FAQ](/hyperliquid-docs/onboarding/how-to-use-the-hyperevm) for more questions.\n###\n\nWhy build on the HyperEVM?\n\nBuilders can plug into a mature, liquid, and performant onchain order books with HyperCore + HyperEVM on Hyperliquid. In addition, Hyperliquid has a captive audience of users who want to be at the forefront of financial change; they are excited to try new applications and conduct finance onchain. See the [HyperEVM developer section](/hyperliquid-docs/for-developers/hyperevm) for more technical details and [tools for HyperEVM builders](/hyperliquid-docs/hyperevm/tools-for-hyperevm-builders) for resources.\n\nAs one example, a project XYZ could deploy an ERC20 contract on the HyperEVM using standard EVM tooling and deploy a corresponding spot asset XYZ permissionlessly in the HyperCore spot auction. Once the HyperCore token and HyperEVM contract are linked, users can use the same XYZ token on HyperEVM applications and trade it with on the native spot order book. This has two key improvements compared to CEX listings: 1) The entire process is permissionless, with no behind-the-scenes negotiations for preferential treatment and 2) There is no bridging risk between HyperCore and HyperEVM as one unified state. Trading and building on the same chain is a 10x product improvement over CEXs.", "doc_path": "/srv/shared/Models/hyperLiquidAgent/test/runs/dataset/hyperliquid-docs_hyperevm.md"}

Trading and building on the same chain is a 10x product improvement over CEXs.\nAs another example, a lending protocol could set up a pool contract that accepts token XYZ as collateral and lends out another token ABC to the borrower. To determine the liquidation threshold, the lending smart contract can read XYZ/ABC prices directly from the HyperCore order books using a read precompile. For a Solidity developer, this is as simple as calling a built-in function. Suppose the borrower's position requires liquidation. The lending smart contract can send orders directly swapping XYZ and ABC on the HyperCore order books using a write system contract. Again, this is a simple built-in function in Solidity. In a few lines of code, the lending protocol has implemented protocolized liquidations similar to how perps function on HyperCore. A theme of the HyperEVM is to abstract away the deep liquidity on HyperCore as a building block for arbitrary user applications.", "doc_path": "/srv/shared/Models/hyperLiquidAgent/test/runs/dataset/hyperliquid-docs_hyperevm.md"}

A theme of the HyperEVM is to abstract away the deep liquidity on HyperCore as a building block for arbitrary user applications.\n###\n\nWhat stage is the HyperEVM in?\n\nThe HyperEVM is in the alpha stage. There are three reasons behind this gradual roll-out approach.\n\nFirst, this stays true to Hyperliquid’s “no insiders” principle; everyone has equal access and starts on a level playing field. The tradeoff is that HyperEVM did not launch with the same tooling you might see on other chains, since no one is given a heads up nor paid for an integration or marketing. These short term obstacles are worth it to be a fair, credibly neutral platform in the long-run.\n\nSecond, a gradual roll-out is the safest way to upgrade a complex system doing billions of dollars of volume a day and protect against performance degradation or downtime.\n\nThird, shipping an MVP and iterating live with user feedback allows development to adjust more nimbly. Testnets are useful for technical testing, but systems can only be hardened through real economic use.\n\nAs such, higher throughput and write system contracts are not live on mainnet yet, but will be in due time.\n\n[PreviousMulti-sig](/hyperliquid-docs/hypercore/multi-sig)[NextTools for HyperEVM builders](/hyperliquid-docs/hyperevm/tools-for-hyperevm-builders)\n\nLast updated 21 days ago", "doc_path": "/srv/shared/Models/hyperLiquidAgent/test/runs/dataset/hyperliquid-docs_hyperevm.md"}

[Hyperliquid Improvement Proposals (HIPs)](/hyperliquid-docs/hyperliquid-improvement-proposals-hips)\n# HIP-1: Native token standard\n\nHIP-1 is a capped supply fungible token standard. It also features onchain spot order books between pairs of HIP-1 tokens.\n\nThe sender of the token genesis transaction will specify the following:\n\n1. `name`: human readable, maximum 6 characters, no uniqueness constraints.\n\n2. `weiDecimals`: the conversion rate from the minimal integer unit of the token to a human-interpretable float. For example, ETH on EVM networks has `weiDecimals = 18` and BTC on Bitcoin network has `weiDecimals = 8`.\n\n3. `szDecimals`: the minimum tradable number of decimals on spot order books. In other words, the lot size of the token on all spot order books will be `10 ** (weiDecimals - szDecimals)`. It is required that `szDecimals + 5 <= weiDecimals`.\n\n4. `maxSupply`: the maximum and initial supply. The supply may decrease over time due to spot order book fees or future burn mechanisms.\n\n5. `initialWei`: optional genesis balances specified by the sender of the transaction. This could include a multisig treasury, an initial bridge mint, etc.\n\n6. `anchorTokenWei` the sender of the transaction can specify existing HIP-1 tokens to proportionally receieve genesis balances.\n\n7. `hyperliquidityInit`: parameters for initializing the Hyperliquidity for the USDC spot pair. See HIP-2 section for more details.\n\nThe deployment transaction of the token will generate a globally unique hash by which the execution logic will index the token.", "doc_path": "/srv/shared/Models/hyperLiquidAgent/test/runs/dataset/hyperliquid-docs_hyperliquid-improvement-proposals-hips_hip-1-native-token-standard.md"}

Currently, the following gas cost is in HYPE.\n\n1. The gas cost of deployment is decided through a dutch auction with duration 31 hours. In this period, the deployment gas decreases linearly from `initial_price` to `500 HYPE` . The initial price is `500 HYPE` if the last auction failed to complete, otherwise 2 times the last gas price.\n\n2. Genesis to existing anchor tokens holders are proportional to `balance - 1e-6 * anchorTokenMaxSupply`at the time of the deployed token's genesis. If this value is negative, no genesis tokens are received. In particular, this means genesis holders must hold at least 0.0001% of the anchor token's max supply at genesis to be included in the deployed token's genesis.\n\n3. Potential workaround for constraint (2): a small initial USDC gas fee (value TBD) for the initial state update of each `(address, token)` pair, either through trading or transfer. Further trades and transfers to initialized ledgers are gas free within the standard Hyperliquid fill rate conditions.", "doc_path": "/srv/shared/Models/hyperLiquidAgent/test/runs/dataset/hyperliquid-docs_hyperliquid-improvement-proposals-hips_hip-1-native-token-standard.md"}

Further trades and transfers to initialized ledgers are gas free within the standard Hyperliquid fill rate conditions.\n###\n\nIMPORTANT GAS DETAILS:\n\nThe only time-sensitive step of the process is the very first step of deploying the token, where the deployer specifies name, szDecimals, and weiDecimals. This step is when the gas is charged and the token is locked in. It is recommended to take all the necessary time after this step to reduce errors. There is no time limit once the gas is paid.\n\nDeployment is a complex multi-stage process, and it is possible to get in a state where your deployment is stuck.

All spot balances that are less than 1 lot size with notional value <= 1 USD will be dusted. Here, the notional value is computed as the prevailing mid price of the token against USDC, times the token balance. All users’ dust across a token is aggregated, and a market sell order is automatically submitted to the book. If the aggregate dust is smaller than one lot size, then that dust is burned. Otherwise, the USDC from the successfully converted dust will be allocated back to all dusted users on a weighted basis, where the weighting is equal to the user’s fraction of the aggregate dust.\n\nDusting will not occur if 1) the book is one-sided or 2) the amount of notional dust is too high such that the book would be impacted by this operation. For PURR, this is 10000 USDC; for all other tokens, this is 3000 USDC. Note: the amount of USDC received may be less than the notional amount computed from the mid because of slippage incurred while dusting or if there was insufficient liquidity to convert the total dust across all users.\n\n[PreviousHyperliquid Improvement Proposals (HIPs)](/hyperliquid-docs/hyperliquid-improvement-proposals-hips)[NextHIP-2: Hyperliquidity](/hyperliquid-docs/hyperliquid-improvement-proposals-hips/hip-2-hyperliquidity)\n\nLast updated 14 days ago", "doc_path": "/srv/shared/Models/hyperLiquidAgent/test/runs/dataset/hyperliquid-docs_hyperliquid-improvement-proposals-hips_hip-1-native-token-standard.md"}

One of Hyperliquid's core design principles is that liquidity should be democratized. For perps trading, HLP can quote deep and tight liquidity based on CEX perp and spot prices, but a new model is needed for HIP-1 tokens that are in early phases of price discovery.\n\nHyperliquidity is inspired by Uniswap, while interoperating with a native onchain order book to support sophisticated order book liquidity from end users. HIP-2 is a fully decentralized onchain strategy that is part of Hyperliquid's block transition logic. Unlike conventional automated order book strategies, there are no operators. The strategy logic is secured by the same consensus that operates the order book itself. Note that Hyperliquidity is currently only available on spot pairs against USDC.\n\nHyperliquidity is parametrized by\n\n1. `spot`: a spot order book asset with USDC quote returned by a deployment of HIP-1\n\n2. `startPx`: the initial price of the range\n\n3. `nOrders`: the number of orders in the range\n\n4. `orderSz`: the size of a full order in the range\n\n5. `nSeededLevels`: the number of levels that begin as bids instead of asks. Note that for each additional bid level added by incrementing `nSeededLevels` the deployer needs to fund Hyperliquidity with `px * sz` worth of USDC. For fixed `nOrders`, increasing seeded levels decreases the total supply because it reduces the genesis supply of Hyperliquidity.\n\nEach Hyperliquidity strategy has a price range defined recursively `px_0 = startPx`, `px_i = round(px_{i-1} * 1.003)`. The strategy updates on every block where the block time is at least 3 seconds since the previous update block. After each update:", "doc_path": "/srv/shared/Models/hyperLiquidAgent/test/runs/dataset/hyperliquid-docs_hyperliquid-improvement-proposals-hips_hip-2-hyperliquidity.md"}

The strategy updates on every block where the block time is at least 3 seconds since the previous update block. After each update:\n1. Strategy targets `nFull = floor(balance / orderSz)` full ask orders and a `balance % orderSz` partial ask order if the partial order is nonzero. To the extent that ALO orders are not rejected, these orders are ensured.\n\n2. Each fully filled tranche is modified to an order of side `orderSz` on the side with available balance, with the exception of the single partial order from (1) if it exists.\n\nThe resulting strategy guarantees a 0.3% spread every 3 seconds. Like smart-contract based pools on general purpose chains, Hyperliquidity requires no maintenance in the form of user transactions. One key improvement is that Hyperliquidity participates in a general purpose order book. Active liquidity providers can join in liquidity provision alongside Hyperliquidity at any time, allowing markets to adapt to increasing demand for liquidity.\n\n[PreviousHIP-1: Native token standard](/hyperliquid-docs/hyperliquid-improvement-proposals-hips/hip-1-native-token-standard)[NextHIP-3: Builder-deployed perpetuals](/hyperliquid-docs/hyperliquid-improvement-proposals-hips/hip-3-builder-deployed-perpetuals)\n\nLast updated 14 days ago", "doc_path": "/srv/shared/Models/hyperLiquidAgent/test/runs/dataset/hyperliquid-docs_hyperliquid-improvement-proposals-hips_hip-2-hyperliquidity.md"}

An MVP of this feature is live on testnet. Feedback is appreciated during this testing phase. Note that numbers and specifications below are not finalized. Builder-deployed perps share many features with HyperCore spot deployments:\n\n1. Deployments allocate new performant onchain orderbooks on HyperCore.\n\n2. Deployment gas in HYPE is paid through a Dutch auction every 31 hours. There is a single Dutch auction across all HIP-3 perp DEXs.\n\n3. Deployers can set a fee share of up to 50%. A difference is that the deployer can configure additional fees on top of the base fee rate. Fee share applies to the total configured fee. The fee share configuration transaction for deployers will be documented once live on testnet.\n\n4. Deployments are fully permissionless.\n\nThe deployer of a perp market is also responsible for\n\n1. Market definition, including the oracle definition and contract specifications\n\n2. Market operation, including setting oracle prices, leverage limits, and settling the market if needed\n\nPerp deployment composes with HyperCore multisig to support protocolized market deployment and operation.\n\nTo ensure high quality markets and protect users, deployers must maintain 1M staked HYPE. In the event of malicious market operation, validators have the authority to slash the deployer’s stake by conducting a stake-weighted vote during the deployer’s 7-day unstaking queue.", "doc_path": "/srv/shared/Models/hyperLiquidAgent/test/runs/dataset/hyperliquid-docs_hyperliquid-improvement-proposals-hips_hip-3-builder-deployed-perpetuals.md"}

Perp deployers can set a custom open interest cap per asset, which is documented in <https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/for-developers/api/hip-3-deployer-actions>[](https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/for-developers/api/hip-3-deployer-actions).\n\nSize-denominated open interest caps are only enforced per-asset.

You will need ETH and USDC on the Arbitrum network, since Hyperliquid’s native bridge is between Hyperliquid and Arbitrum. ETH will only be used as gas for transactions to deposit USDC. Trading on Hyperliquid does not cost gas.\n\n1. You can use various bridges, such as <https://bridge.arbitrum.io/>[](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/), <https://app.debridge.finance/>[](https://app.debridge.finance/), <https://swap.mayan.finance/>[](https://swap.mayan.finance/), <https://app.across.to/bridge?>[](https://app.across.to/bridge?), <https://routernitro.com/swap>[](https://routernitro.com/swap), <https://jumper.exchange/>[](https://jumper.exchange/), and <https://synapseprotocol.com/>[](https://synapseprotocol.com/)\n\n2. Alternatively, you can move funds directly to Arbitrum from a centralized exchange, if you’re already using one.\n\n2. Once you have ETH and USDC on Arbitrum, you can deposit by clicking the “Deposit” button on [https://app.hyperliquid.xyz/trade](https://hyperliquid.xyz/trade)", "doc_path": "/srv/shared/Models/hyperLiquidAgent/test/runs/dataset/hyperliquid-docs_onboarding_how-to-start-trading.md"}

You can build an application on the HyperEVM involving lending, trading, yield generation, etc. That application can directly access the liquidity on the order books, so that defi has CEX-like functionality for the first time.

Because HyperCore and the HyperEVM share the same state, it is technically risky to allow the HyperEVM to consume more bandwidth on initial launch. The HyperEVM throughput will be increased over time in a gradual technical rollout.\n\nGas spikes on any chain when there is more demand than supply of blockspace.

Note that builder codes override referral codes for that order, and referral codes are disabled after the user trades $1B cumulative volume.\n###\n\nHow it works\n\nThe staking referral program interacts with staking tier fee discounts and the VIP tier fee schedule. If a builder or referrer has a higher staking tier than their referred user on a trade, they keep up to 100% of the difference. The percentage kept by the builder or referrer decreases as the volume tier of the referred user increases, starting at 100% for VIP 0 and ending at 40% for VIP 6.\n\nAs an example: Alice has 100k staked HYPE, which gives a trading fee discount of 30%. Bob has 100 staked HYPE, which gives a trading fee discount of 10%, and Bob is at VIP 1. If Bob uses Alice’s builder or referral code, Alice can keep (30% - 10%) * 90% = 18% of the fees that Bob pays. Alice could share with Bob up to 9% of his fees. In other words, Bob could receive up to a 9% trading fee discount using Alice’s builder or referral code.\n\nVIP tier\n\n14d weighted volume ($)\n\nAmount kept by builder or referrer\n\n0\n\n100%\n\n1\n\n>5M\n\n90%\n\n2\n\n>25M\n\n80%\n\n3\n\n>100M\n\n70%\n\n4\n\n>500M\n\n60%\n\n5\n\n>2B\n\n50%\n\n6\n\n>7B\n\n40%\n\n_Note these tiers correspond to the fee schedules in_[Fees](/hyperliquid-docs/trading/fees)\n\n[PreviousReferrals](/hyperliquid-docs/referrals)[NextPoints](/hyperliquid-docs/points)\n\nLast updated 1 month ago", "doc_path": "/srv/shared/Models/hyperLiquidAgent/test/runs/dataset/hyperliquid-docs_referrals_proposal-staking-referral-program.md"}

The builder must have at least 100 USDC in perps account value.\n\nBuilder codes currently only apply to fees that are collected in USDC, i.e. builder codes do not apply to the buying side of spot trades. Builder fees charged can be at most 0.1% on perps and 1% on spot.\n\nOnce the authorization is complete, future order actions sent on behalf of the user may include an optional builder parameter: `{\"b\": address, \"f\": number}`. `b` is the address of the builder and `f` is the builder fee to charge in tenths of basis points. I.e. a value of 10 means 1 basis point.\n\nBuilders can claim fees from builder codes through the usual referral reward claim process.\n\nFor example code see the Python SDK <https://github.com/hyperliquid-dex/hyperliquid-python-sdk/blob/master/examples/basic_builder_fee.py>[](https://github.com/hyperliquid-dex/hyperliquid-python-sdk/blob/master/examples/basic_builder_fee.py)", "doc_path": "/srv/shared/Models/hyperLiquidAgent/test/runs/dataset/hyperliquid-docs_trading_builder-codes.md"}

Instead, they rely on funding payments to ensure convergence to the underlying spot price over time. See [Funding](/hyperliquid-docs/trading/funding) for more information.\n\nHyperliquid has one main style of margining for perpetual contracts: USDC margining, USDT denominated linear contracts. That is, the oracle price is denominated in USDT, but the collateral is USDC. This allows for the best combination of liquidity and accessibility. Note that no conversions with the USDC/USDT exchange rate are applied, so these contracts are technically quanto contracts where USDT pnl is denominated in USDC.\n\nWhen the spot asset's primary source of liquidity is USDC denominated, the oracle price is denominated in USDC. Currently, the only USDC-denominated perpetual contracts are PURR-USD and HYPE-USD, where the most liquid spot oracle source is Hyperliquid spot.\n\nHyperliquid's contract specifications are simpler than most platforms.

Funding is purely peer-to-peer and no fees are collected on the payments.\n\nThe rate is calculated based on the difference between the contract's price and the spot price of the underlying asset. For consistency with CEXs, interest rate component is predetermined at 0.01% every 8 hours, which is 0.00125% every hour, or 11.6% APR paid to short. This represents the difference in cost to borrow USD versus spot crypto.\n\nThe premium component fluctuates based on the difference between the perpetual contract's price and the underlying spot oracle price. If the contract's price is higher than the oracle price, the premium and hence the funding rate will be positive, and the long position will pay the short position. Conversely, if the contract's price is lower than the spot price, the funding rate will be negative, and the short position will pay the long position.\n\nThe funding rate on Hyperliquid is paid every hour. The funding rate is added or subtracted from the balance the contract holders at the funding interval.\n\nFunding rates are designed to prevent large price disparities between the perpetual contract and the underlying asset. When the funding rate is high, it can incentivize traders to take the opposite position and help to bring the contract's price closer to the spot price of the underlying asset.", "doc_path": "/srv/shared/Models/hyperLiquidAgent/test/runs/dataset/hyperliquid-docs_trading_funding.md"}

When the funding rate is high, it can incentivize traders to take the opposite position and help to bring the contract's price closer to the spot price of the underlying asset.\n###\n\nTechnical details\n\nFunding on Hyperliquid is designed to closely match the process used by centralized perpetual exchanges.\n\nThe funding rate formula applies to 8 hour funding rate. However, funding is paid every hour at one eighth of the computed rate for each hour.\n\nThe specific formula is `Funding Rate (F) = Average Premium Index (P) + clamp (interest rate - Premium Index (P), -0.0005, 0.0005)`. The premium is sampled every 5 seconds and averaged over the hour.\n\nAs described in the [clearinghouse](/hyperliquid-docs/hypercore/clearinghouse) section, the oracle prices are computed by each validator as the weighted median of CEX spot prices for each asset, with weights depending on the liquidity of the CEX.\n\n`premium = impact_price_difference / oracle_price`\n\nwhere\n\n`impact_price_difference = max(impact_bid_px - oracle_px, 0) - max(oracle_px - impact_ask_px, 0)`\n\nand `impact_bid_px` and `impact_ask_px` are the average execution prices to trade`impact_notional_usd` on the bid and ask sides, respectively. See the contract specifications for the impact notional used, as well as other contract specific parameters.\n\nFunding on Hyperliquid is capped at 4%/hour. Note that this is much less aggressive capping than CEX counterparts. The funding cap and funding interval do not depend on the asset.\n\nNote that the funding payment at the end of the interval is `position_size * oracle_price * funding_rate`. In particular, the spot oracle price is used to convert the position size to notional value, _not the mark price._", "doc_path": "/srv/shared/Models/hyperLiquidAgent/test/runs/dataset/hyperliquid-docs_trading_funding.md"}

In particular, the spot oracle price is used to convert the position size to notional value, _not the mark price._\n###\n\nNumerical Example\n\nHere is an explicit example computation:\n\n1. The interest rate is 0.01% (fixed).\n\n2. The perpetual contract is trading at a premium, with the impact bid price being $10,100, and the spot price at $10,000.\n\n3. The premium index is calculated as the difference between the two prices, which is $100 in this case.\n\n4. The funding interval is 1 hour.\n\n5. You hold a long position of 10 contracts, each representing 1 BTC.\n\nFirst, calculate the premium:\n\nPremium = (Impact bid price - Spot Price) / Spot Price = ($10,100 - $10,000) / $10,000 Premium = 0.01 (or 1%)\n\nNext, clamp the interest rate minus the premium rate at 0.05%:\n\nClamped Difference = min(max(Interest Rate - Premium Rate, -0.05%), 0.05%)\n\nClamped Difference = min(max(0.01% - 1%, -0.05%), 0.05%)\n\nClamped Difference = min(max(-0.99%, -0.05%), 0.05%) Clamped Difference = -0.05%\n\nNow, calculate the funding rate:\n\nFunding Rate = Premium Rate + Clamped Difference Funding Rate = 1% + (-0.05%)\n\nFunding Rate = 0.95%\n\n[PreviousEntry price and pnl](/hyperliquid-docs/trading/entry-price-and-pnl)[NextMiscellaneous UI](/hyperliquid-docs/trading/miscellaneous-ui)\n\nLast updated 5 months ago", "doc_path": "/srv/shared/Models/hyperLiquidAgent/test/runs/dataset/hyperliquid-docs_trading_funding.md"}

The maintenance margin is half of the initial margin at max leverage, which varies from 3-40x. In other words, the maintenance margin is between 1.25% (for 40x max leverage assets) and 16.7% (for 3x max leverage assets) depending on the asset.\n\nWhen the account equity drops below maintenance margin, the positions are first attempted to be entirely closed by sending market orders to the book. The orders are for the full size of the position, and may be fully or partially closed. If the positions are entirely or partially closed such that the maintenance margin requirements are met, any remaining collateral remains with the trader.\n\nIf the account equity drops below 2/3 of the maintenance margin without successful liquidation through the book, a backstop liquidation happens through the liquidator vault. See Liquidator Vault explanation below for more details.\n\nWhen a cross position is backstop liquidated, the trader's cross positions and cross margin are all transferred to the liquidator. In particular, if the trader has no isolated positions, the trader ends up with zero account equity.\n\nWhen an isolated position is backstop liquidated, that isolated position and isolated margin are transferred to the liquidator. The user's cross margin and positions are untouched.\n\nDuring backstop liquidation, the maintenance margin is not returned to the user. This is because the liquidator vault requires a buffer to make sure backstop liquidations are profitable on average.

This estimation may be inaccurate compared to the position's estimated liquidation price due to changing liquidity on the book.\n\nOnce a position is opened, a liquidation price is shown. This price has the certainty of the entry price, but still may not be the actual liquidation price due to funding payments or changes in unrealized pnl in other positions (for cross margin positions).\n\nThe actual liquidation price is independent on the leverage set for cross margin positions. A cross margin position at lower leverage simply uses more collateral.\n\nThe liquidation price does depend on leverage set for isolated margin positions, because the amount of isolated margin allocated depends on the initial margin set.\n\nWhen there is insufficient margin to make the trade, the liquidation price estimate assumes that the account is topped up to the initial margin requirement.\n\nThe precise formula for the liquidation price of a position is\n\n`liq_price = price - side * margin_available / position_size / (1 - l * side)`\n\nwhere\n\n`l = 1 / MAINTENANCE_LEVERAGE` .

Mark price is updated whenever validators publish new oracle prices. Therefore, mark and oracle price are updated approximately once every 3 seconds.\n\nThe EMA update formula is defined as follows for an update value of `sample` at duration `t` since the last update\n\n`ema = numerator / denominator`\n\n`numerator -> numerator * exp(-t / 2.5 minutes) + sample * t `\n\n`denominator -> denominator * exp(-t / 2.5 minutes) + t`\n\n[PreviousAuto-deleveraging](/hyperliquid-docs/trading/auto-deleveraging)[NextSelf-trade prevention](/hyperliquid-docs/trading/self-trade-prevention)\n\nLast updated 3 months ago", "doc_path": "/srv/shared/Models/hyperLiquidAgent/test/runs/dataset/hyperliquid-docs_trading_robust-price-indices.md"}

Around 1M HYPE was sent back to KuCoin after this, which then funded Eyenovia with 60K HYPE. The remaining 940K HYPE was transferred back to FalconX/KuCoin cold wallets.\n\nHowever, there’s still 1.06M HYPE sitting on Gate.io, which is strange. I think it’s currently being sold - though it’s unclear if that’s happening directly on Gate (due to low liquidity/scam cex) or through another route. This could explain the underperformance. No hard evidence yet, but it does make sense if you think about it.\n\nDoes anyone have any takes on this? Could this be a plausible explanation for what's going on or was it normal wallet management?\n\nUpdate: They use Kucoin/Gate to hide their onchain transactions in wallets, and FalconX can't trade directly on Hyperliquid directly for compliance/operational reasons. We cant know if it was being sold.", "doc_path": "/srv/shared/Models/hyperLiquidAgent/test/runs/dataset/message-399.md"}
