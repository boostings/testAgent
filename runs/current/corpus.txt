###

Technical overview

Hyperliquid is a layer one blockchain (L1) written and optimized from first principles.

Hyperliquid uses a custom consensus algorithm called HyperBFT inspired by Hotstuff and its successors. Both the algorithm and networking stack are optimized from the ground up to support the unique demands of the L1.

Hyperliquid state execution is split into two broad components: HyperCore and the HyperEVM. HyperCore includes fully onchain perpetual futures and spot order books. Every order, cancel, trade, and liquidation happens transparently with one-block finality inherited from HyperBFT. HyperCore currently supports 200k orders / second, with throughput constantly improving as the node software is further optimized.

The HyperEVM brings the familiar general-purpose smart contract platform pioneered by Ethereum to the Hyperliquid blockchain. With the HyperEVM, the performant liquidity and financial primitives of HyperCore are available as permissionless building blocks for all users and builders. See the HyperEVM documentation section for more technical details.

# Core contributors

Hyperliquid Labs is a core contributor supporting the growth of Hyperliquid, led by [Jeff](https://twitter.com/chameleon_jeff) and iliensinc, who are classmates from Harvard. Other members of the team are from Caltech and MIT and previously worked at Airtable, Citadel, Hudson River Trading, and Nuro.

The team used to do proprietary market making in crypto in 2020 and expanded into defi in the summer of 2022. Existing platforms were plagued with issues, such as poor market design, bad tech, and clunky UX. It was easy to make money trading on these protocols, but disappointing to see how far behind defi was compared to its centralized counterparts. The team set out to build a product that could solve these issues and provide users with a seamless trading experience.

Designing a performant decentralized L1 with an order book DEX built-in requires an intimate understanding of quantitative trading, cutting-edge blockchain technology, and clean UX, which the team is well-positioned to deliver. The team actively engages with and listens to the community; you are welcome to join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/hyperliquid) to ask questions and share feedback.

Lastly, Hyperliquid Labs is self-funded and has not taken any external capital, which allows the team to focus on building a product they believe in without external pressure.

# Asset IDs | Hyperliquid Docs

# Asset IDs

Perpetual endpoints expect an integer for `asset`, which is the index of the coin found in the `meta` info response. E.g. `BTC = 0` on mainnet.

Spot endpoints expect `10000 + spotInfo["index"]` where `spotInfo` is the corresponding object in `spotMeta` that has the desired quote and base tokens. For example, when submitting an order for `PURR/USDC`, the asset that should be used is `10000` because its asset index in the spot info is `0`.

Builder-deployed perps expect `100000 + perp_dex_index * 10000 + index_in_meta` . For example, `test:ABC` on testnet has `perp_dex_index = 1` ,`index_in_meta = 0` , `asset = 110000` . Note that builder-deployed perps always have name in the format `{dex}:{coin}` .

###

Examples

Note that spot ID is different from token ID, and that mainnet and testnet have different asset IDs. For example, for HYPE:

Mainnet token ID: 150

Mainnet spot ID: 107

Testnet token ID: 1105

Testnet spot ID: 1035

Deposit

The deposit flow for the bridge is simple. The user sends native USDC to the bridge, and it is credited to the account that sent it in less than 1 minute. The minimum deposit amount is 5 USDC. If you send an amount less than this, it will not be credited and be lost forever.

# Error responses

Order and cancel errors are usually returned as a vector with same length as the batched request.

Below is a list of possible batched error responses:

Error source

Error type

Error string

Order

Tick

Price must be divisible by tick size.

Order

MinTradeNtl

Order must have minimum value of $10.

Order

MinTradeSpotNtl

Order must have minimum value of 10 {quote_token}.

Order

PerpMargin

Insufficient margin to place order.

Order

ReduceOnly

Reduce only order would increase position.

Order

BadAloPx

Post only order would have immediately matched, bbo was {bbo}.

Order

IocCancel

Order could not immediately match against any resting orders.

Order

BadTriggerPx

Invalid TP/SL price.

Order

MarketOrderNoLiquidity

No liquidity available for market order.

Order

PositionIncreaseAtOpenInterestCap

Order would increase open interest while open interest is capped

Order

PositionFlipAtOpenInterestCap

Order would increase open interest while open interest is capped

Order

TooAggressiveAtOpenInterestCap

Order rejected due to price more aggressive than oracle while at open interest cap

Order

OpenInterestIncrease

Order would increase open interest too quickly

Order

InsufficientSpotBalance

(Spot-only) Order has insufficient spot balance to trade

Order

Oracle

Order price too far from oracle

Order

PerpMaxPosition

Order would cause position to exceed margin tier limit at current leverage

Cancel

MissingOrder

Order was never placed, already canceled, or filled.

Important: Some errors are a deterministic function of the payload itself, and these are instead returned earlier as part of pre-validation. In this case only one error is returned for the entire payload, as some of these errors do not apply to a specific order or cancel.

Examples include: empty batch of orders, non-reduce-only TP/SL orders, and some forms of tick size validation.

the entire payload, as some of these errors do not apply to a specific order or cancel.

Examples include: empty batch of orders, non-reduce-only TP/SL orders, and some forms of tick size validation.
For API users that use batching, it's recommended to handle the case where a single error is returned for a batch of multiple orders. In this case, the response could be duplicated `n`times before being sent to the callback function, as the whole batch was rejected for this same reason.

For API users that use historical orders, a list of all the cancel / reject historical order statuses can be found [here](https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/for-developers/api/info-endpoint#query-order-status-by-oid-or-cloid).

###

Asset

Many of the requests take asset as an input. For perpetuals this is the index in the `universe` field returned by the`meta` response. For spot assets, use `10000 + index` where `index` is the corresponding index in `spotMeta.universe`. For example, when submitting an order for `PURR/USDC`, the asset that should be used is `10000` because its asset index in the spot metadata is `0`.

###

Subaccounts and vaults

Subaccounts and vaults do not have private keys. To perform actions on behalf of a subaccount or vault signing should be done by the master account and the vaultAddress field should be set to the address of the subaccount or vault. The basic_vault.py example in the Python SDK demonstrates this.

r vault signing should be done by the master account and the vaultAddress field should be set to the address of the subaccount or vault. The basic_vault.py example in the Python SDK demonstrates this.
###

Expires After

Some actions support an optional field `expiresAfter` which is a timestamp in milliseconds after which the action will be rejected. User-signed actions such as Core USDC transfer do not support the `expiresAfter` field. Note that actions consume 5x the usual address-based rate limit when canceled due to a stale `expiresAfter` field.

See the Python SDK for details on how to incorporate this field when signing.

##

Place an order

`POST` `https://api.hyperliquid.xyz/exchange`

See Python SDK for full featured examples on the fields of the order request.

For limit orders, TIF (time-in-force) sets the behavior of the order upon first hitting the book.

ALO (add liquidity only, i.e. "post only") will be canceled instead of immediately matching.

IOC (immediate or cancel) will have the unfilled part canceled instead of resting.

GTC (good til canceled) orders have no special behavior.

Client Order ID (cloid) is an optional 128 bit hex string, e.g. `0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef`

Perpetuals vs Spot

The endpoints in this section as well as websocket subscriptions work for both Perpetuals and Spot. For perpetuals `coin` is the name returned in the `meta` response. For Spot, coin should be `PURR/USDC` for PURR, and `@{index}` e.g. `@1` for all other spot tokens where index is the index of the spot pair in the `universe` field of the `spotMeta` response. For example, the spot index for HYPE on mainnet is `@107` because the token index of HYPE is 150 and the spot pair `@107` has tokens `[150, 0]`. Note that some assets may be remapped on user interfaces. For example, `BTC/USDC` on app.hyperliquid.xyz corresponds to `UBTC/USDC` on mainnet HyperCore. The L1 name on the [token details page](https://app.hyperliquid.xyz/explorer/token/0x8f254b963e8468305d409b33aa137c67) can be used to detect remappings.

User address

To query the account data associated with a master or sub-account, you must pass in the actual address of that account. A common pitfall is to use an agent wallet's address which leads to an empty result.

# Nonces and API wallets
###

Background

A decentralized L1 must prevent replay attacks. When a user signs a USDC transfer transaction, the receiver cannot broadcast it multiple times to drain the sender's wallet. To solve this Ethereum stores a "nonce" for each address, which is a number that starts at 0. Each transaction must use exactly "nonce + 1" to be included.

###

API wallets

These are also known as `agent wallets` in the docs. A master account can approve API wallets to sign on behalf of the master account or any of the sub-accounts.

Note that API wallets are only used to sign. To query the account data associated with a master or sub-account, you must pass in the actual address of that account. A common pitfall is to use the agent wallet which leads to an empty result.

###

API wallet pruning

API wallets and their associated nonce state may be pruned in the following cases:

1. The wallet is deregistered. This happens to an existing unnamed API Wallet when an ApproveAgent action is sent to register a new unnamed API Wallet. This also happens to an existing named API Wallet when an ApproveAgent action is sent with a matching name.

2. The wallet expires.

3. The account that registered the agent no longer has funds.

**Important:** for those using API wallets programmatically, it is **strongly** suggested to not reuse their addresses. Once an agent is deregistered, its used nonce state may be pruned. Generate a new agent wallet on future use to avoid unexpected behavior. For example, previously signed actions can be replayed once the nonce set is pruned.

###

Hyperliquid nonces

Ethereum's design does not work for an onchain order book. A market making strategy can send thousands of orders and cancels in a second. Requiring a precise ordering of inclusion on the blockchain will break any strategy.

On Hyperliquid, the 100 highest nonces are stored per address. Every new transaction must have nonce larger than the smallest nonce in this set and also never have been used before. Nonces are tracked per signer, which is the user address if signed with private key of the address, or the agent address if signed with an API wallet.

Nonces must be within `(T - 2 days, T + 1 day)`, where `T` is the unix millisecond timestamp on the block of the transaction.

The following steps may help port over an automated strategy from a centralized exchange:

1. Use a API wallet per trading process. Note that nonces are stored per signer (i.e. private key), so separate subaccounts signed by the same API wallet will share the nonce tracker of the API wallet. It's recommended to use separate API wallets for different subaccounts.

2. In each trading process, have a task that periodically batches order and cancel requests every 0.1 seconds. It is recommended to batch IOC and GTC orders separately from ALO orders because ALO order-only batches are prioritized by the validators.

3. The trading logic tasks send orders and cancels to the batching task.

4. For each batch of orders or cancels, fetch and increment an atomic counter that ensures a unique nonce for the address. The atomic counter can be fast-forwarded to current unix milliseconds if needed.

This structure is robust to out-of-order transactions within 2 seconds, which should be sufficient for an automated strategy geographically near an API server.

This structure is robust to out-of-order transactions within 2 seconds, which should be sufficient for an automated strategy geographically near an API server.
###

Suggestions for subaccount and vault users

Note that nonces are stored per signer, which is the address of the private key used to sign the transaction. Therefore, it's recommended that each trading process or frontend session use a separate private key for signing. In particular, a single API wallet signing for a user, vault, or subaccount all share the same nonce set.

If users want to use multiple subaccounts in parallel, it would easier to generate two separate API wallets under the master account, and use one API wallet for each subaccount. This avoids collisions between the nonce set used by each subaccount.

The following optimizations may help latency-sensitive traders:

1. Run a non-validating node against a reliable peer, such as Hyper Foundation non-validator.

2. Run node with `--disable-output-file-buffering` to get outputs as soon as blocks are executed

3. Run node with sufficient machines specs, at least 32 logical cores and 500 MB/s disk throughput. Increasing cores can reduce latency because blocks will be faster to execute.

4. Construct book and other exchange state locally using outputs from node, which has faster and more granular data than the API. See <https://github.com/hyperliquid-dex/order_book_server>[](https://github.com/hyperliquid-dex/order_book_server) for an example on how to build an order book on the same machine that is running a node.

5. `--batch-by-block ` on the node will wait until the end of the block to write the data. The example order book server above uses this to simplify logic, but a further optimization could include turning the flag off and inferring block boundaries otherwise.

6. Consider canceling pending orders by invalidating the nonce instead of spamming the cancelation action. This will save on user rate limits and have a guaranteed success rate if the nonce invalidation transaction lands first. A cheap transaction to use for nonce invalidation is `noop` with no additional fields.

# Rate limits and user limits

The following rate limits apply per IP address:

* REST requests share an aggregated weight limit of 1200 per minute.

* All documented `exchange` API requests have a weight of `1 + floor(batch_length / 40)`. For example, unbatched actions have weight `1` and a batched order request of length 79 has weight `2`. Here, `batch_length`is the length of the array in the action, e.g. the number of orders in a batched order action.

* The following `info` requests have weight 2: `l2Book, allMids, clearinghouseState, orderStatus, spotClearinghouseState, exchangeStatus.`

* The following `info` requests have weight 60: `userRole` .

* All other documented `info` requests have weight 20.

* The following `info` endpoints have an additional rate limit weight per 20 items returned in the response: `recentTrades`, `historicalOrders`, `userFills`, `userFillsByTime`, `fundingHistory`, `userFunding`, `nonUserFundingUpdates`, `twapHistory`, `userTwapSliceFills`, `userTwapSliceFillsByTime`, `delegatorHistory`, `delegatorRewards`, `validatorStats` .

* The `candleSnapshot` info endpoint has an additional rate limit weight per 60 items returned in the response.

* All `explorer` API requests have a weight of 40. Note that older blocks which have not been recently queried may be weighted more heavily. For large batch requests, use the S3 bucket instead.

* Maximum of 100 websocket connections

* Maximum of 1000 websocket subscriptions

* Maximum of 10 unique users across user-specific websocket subscriptions

* Maximum of 2000 messages sent to Hyperliquid per minute across all websocket connections

* Maximum of 100 simultaneous inflight post messages across all websocket connections

* Maximum of 100 EVM JSON-RPC requests per minute for `rpc.hyperliquid.xyz/evm`. Note that other JSON-RPC providers have more sophisticated rate limiting logic and archive node functionality.

Address-based limits

Address-based limits apply per user, with sub-accounts treated as separate users.

The rate limiting logic allows 1 request per 1 USDC traded cumulatively since address inception. For example, with an order value of 100 USDC, this requires a fill rate of 1%. Each address starts with an initial buffer of 10000 requests. When rate limited, an address is allowed one request every 10 seconds. Cancels have cumulative limit `min(limit + 100000, limit * 2)` where `limit` is the default limit for other actions. This way, hitting the address-based rate limit still allows open orders to be canceled. Note that this rate limit only applies to actions, not info requests.

Each user has a default open order limit of 1000 plus one additional order for every 5M USDC of volume, capped at a total of 5000 open orders. When an order is placed with at least 1000 other open orders by the same user, it will be rejected if it is reduce-only or a trigger order.

During high congestion, addresses are limited to use 2x their maker share percentage of the block space. During high traffic, it can therefore be helpful to not resend cancels whose results have already been returned via the API.

###

Batched Requests

A batched request with `n` orders (or cancels) is treated as one request for IP based rate limiting, but as `n` requests for address-based rate limiting.

# Signing

It is recommended to use an existing SDK instead of manually generating signatures. There are many potential ways in which signatures can be wrong. An incorrect signature results in recovering a different signer based on the signature and payload and results in one of the following errors: `"L1 error: User or API Wallet 0x0123... does not exist."` `Must deposit before performing actions. User: 0x123...` where the returned address does not match the public address of the wallet you are signing with. The returned address also changes for different inputs. An incorrect signature does not indicate why it is incorrect which makes debugging more challenging. To debug this it is recommended to read through the Python SDK carefully and make sure the implementation matches exactly. If that doesn't work, add logging to find where the output diverges.

Some common errors: 1\. Not realizing that there are two signing schemes (the Python SDK methods are `sign_l1_action` vs `sign_user_signed_action`). 2\. Not realizing that the order of fields matter for msgpack. 3\. Issues with trailing zeroes on numbers. 4\. Issues with upper case characters in address fields. It is recommended to lowercase any address before signing and sending. Sometimes the field is parsed as bytes, causing it to be lowercased automatically across the network. 5\. Believing that the signature must be correct because calling recover signer locally results in the correct address. The payload for recover signer is constructed based on the action and does not necessarily match.

# Tick and lot size

Both Price (px) and Size (sz) have a maximum number of decimals that are accepted.

Prices can have up to 5 significant figures, but no more than `MAX_DECIMALS - szDecimals` decimal places where `MAX_DECIMALS` is 6 for perps and 8 for spot. Integer prices are always allowed, regardless of the number of significant figures. E.g. `123456` is a valid price even though `12345.6` is not.

Sizes are rounded to the `szDecimals` of that asset. For example, if `szDecimals = 3` then `1.001` is a valid size but `1.0001` is not.

`szDecimals` for an asset is found in the meta response to the info endpoint

WebSocket endpoints are available for real-time data streaming and as an alternative to HTTP request sending on the Hyperliquid exchange. The WebSocket URLs by network are:

* Mainnet: `wss://api.hyperliquid.xyz/ws`

* Testnet: `wss://api.hyperliquid-testnet.xyz/ws`.

as an alternative to HTTP request sending on the Hyperliquid exchange. The WebSocket URLs by network are:

* Mainnet: `wss://api.hyperliquid.xyz/ws`

* Testnet: `wss://api.hyperliquid-testnet.xyz/ws`.
###

Connecting

To connect to the WebSocket API, you must establish a WebSocket connection to the respective URL based on your desired network. Once connected, you can start sending subscription messages to receive real-time data updates.

Example from command line:

Copy
    
    
    $ wscat -c  wss://api.hyperliquid.xyz/ws
    Connected (press CTRL+C to quit)
    >  { "method": "subscribe", "subscription": { "type": "trades", "coin": "SOL" } }
    < {"channel":"subscriptionResponse","data":{"method":"subscribe","subscription":{"type":"trades","coin":"SOL"}}}

Note: this doc uses Typescript for defining many of the message types. If you prefer to use Python, you can check out the equivalent types in the python SDK [here](https://github.com/hyperliquid-dex/hyperliquid-python-sdk/blob/master/hyperliquid/utils/types.py) and example connection code [here](https://github.com/hyperliquid-dex/hyperliquid-python-sdk/blob/master/hyperliquid/websocket_manager.py).

###

Request format

The WebSocket API supports posting requests that you can normally post through the HTTP API. These requests are either info requests or signed actions. For examples of info request payloads, please refer to the Info endpoint section. For examples of signed action payloads, please refer to the Exchange endpoint section.

To send such a payload for either type via the WebSocket API, you must wrap it as such:

Copy
    
    
    {
      "method": "post",
      "id": <number>,
      "request": {
        "type": "info" | "action",
        "payload": { ... }
      }
    }

Note: The `method` and `id` fields are mandatory. It is recommended that you use a unique `id` for every post request you send in order to track outstanding requests through the channel.

Note: `explorer` requests are not supported via WebSocket.

ry. It is recommended that you use a unique `id` for every post request you send in order to track outstanding requests through the channel.

Note: `explorer` requests are not supported via WebSocket.
###

Response format

The server will respond to post requests with either a success or an error. For errors, a `String` is returned mirroring the HTTP status code and description that would have been returned if the request were sent through HTTP.

Copy
    
    
    {
      "channel": "post",
      "data": {
        "id": <number>,
        "response": {
          "type": "info" | "action" | "error",
          "payload": { ... }
        }
      }
    }

{
      "channel": "post",
      "data": {
        "id": <number>,
        "response": {

          "payload": { ... }
        }
      }
    }

Subscription messages

To subscribe to specific data feeds, you need to send a subscription message. The subscription message format is as follows:

Copy
    
    
    {
      "method": "subscribe",
      "subscription": { ... }
    }

The subscription ack provides a snapshot of previous data for time series data (e.g. user fills). These snapshot messages are tagged with `isSnapshot: true` and can be ignored if the previous messages were already processed.

The subscription object contains the details of the specific feed you want to subscribe to. Choose from the following subscription types and provide the corresponding properties:

1. `allMids`:

* Subscription message: `{ "type": "allMids", "dex": "<dex>" }`

* Data format: `AllMids`

* The `dex` field represents the perp dex to source mids from.

* Note that the `dex` field is optional. If not provided, then the first perp dex is used. Spot mids are only included with the first perp dex.

2. `notification`:

* Subscription message: `{ "type": "notification", "user": "<address>" }`

* Data format: `Notification`

3. `webData2`

* Subscription message: `{ "type": "webData2", "user": "<address>" }`

* Data format: `WsUserTwapHistory`

16. `bbo` :

* Subscription message: `{ "type": "bbo", "coin": "<coin>" }`

* Data format: `WsBbo`
###

Data formats

The server will respond to successful subscriptions with a message containing the `channel` property set to `"subscriptionResponse"`, along with the `data` field providing the original subscription. The server will then start sending messages with the `channel` property set to the corresponding subscription type e.g. `"allMids"` and the `data` field providing the subscribed data.

The `data` field format depends on the subscription type:

* `AllMids`: All mid prices.

* Format: `AllMids { mids: Record<string, string> }`

* `Notification`: A notification message.

* Format: `Notification { notification: string }`

* `WebData2`: Aggregate information about a user, used primarily for the frontend.

* Format: `WebData2`

* `WsTrade[]`: An array of trade updates.

* Format: `WsTrade[]`

* `WsBook`: Order book snapshot updates.

* Format: `WsBook { coin: string; levels: [Array<WsLevel>, Array<WsLevel>]; time: number; }`

* `WsOrder`: User order updates.

* Format: `WsOrder[]`

* `WsUserEvent`: User events that are not order updates

* Format: `WsUserEvent { "fills": [WsFill] | "funding": WsUserFunding | "liquidation": WsLiquidation | "nonUserCancel": [WsNonUserCancel] }`

* `WsUserFills` : Fills snapshot followed by streaming fills

* `WsUserFundings` : Funding payments snapshot followed by funding payments on the hour

* `WsUserNonFundingLedgerUpdates`: Ledger updates not including funding payments: withdrawals, deposits, transfers, and liquidations

* `WsBbo` : Bbo updates that are sent only if the bbo changes on a block

For the streaming user endpoints such as `WsUserFills`,`WsUserFundings `the first message has `isSnapshot: true` and the following streaming updates have `isSnapshot: false`.

Unsubscribing from WebSocket feeds

To unsubscribe from a specific data feed on the Hyperliquid WebSocket API, you need to send an unsubscribe message with the following format:

Copy
    
    
    {
      "method": "unsubscribe",
      "subscription": { ... }
    }

The `subscription` object should match the original subscription message that was sent when subscribing to the feed. This allows the server to identify the specific feed you want to unsubscribe from. By sending this unsubscribe message, you inform the server to stop sending further updates for the specified feed.

Please note that unsubscribing from a specific feed does not affect other subscriptions you may have active at that time. To unsubscribe from multiple feeds, you can send multiple unsubscribe messages, each with the appropriate subscription details.

This page describes the measures to keep WebSocket connections alive.

The server will close any connection if it hasn't sent a message to it in the last 60 seconds. If you are subscribing to a channel that doesn't receive messages every 60 seconds, you can send heartbeat messages to keep your connection alive. The format for these messages are:

Copy
    
    
    { "method": "ping" }

The server will respond with:

Copy
    
    
    { "channel": "pong" }

# HyperEVM

The HyperEVM consists of EVM blocks built as part of Hyperliquid's execution, inheriting all security from HyperBFT consensus. HYPE is the native gas token on the HyperEVM. To move HYPE from HyperCore to HyperEVM, send HYPE to `0x2222222222222222222222222222222222222222`. See the instructions in [Native Transfers](/hyperliquid-docs/for-developers/hyperevm/hypercore-less-than-greater-than-hyperevm-transfers) for more details on how this works.

Note that there are currently no official frontend components of the EVM. Users can build their own frontends or port over existing EVM applications. All interaction with the EVM happens through the JSON-RPC. For example, users can add the chain to their wallets by entering the RPC URL and chain ID. There is currently no websocket JSON-RPC support for the RPC at `rpc.hyperliquid.xyz/evm`but other RPC implementations may support it.

The HyperEVM uses the Cancun hardfork without blobs. In particular, EIP-1559 is enabled on the HyperEVM. Base fees are burned as usual, implemented in the standard way where the burned fees are removed from the total EVM supply. Unlike most other EVM chains, priority fees are also burned because the HyperEVM uses HyperBFT consensus. The burned priority fees are sent to the zero address's EVM balance.

On both mainnet and testnet, HYPE on the HyperEVM has 18 decimals. A few differences between testnet and mainnet HyperEVM are highlighted below:

# Dual-block architecture

The total HyperEVM throughput is split between small blocks produced at a fast rate and large blocks produced at a slower rate.

The primary motivation behind the dual-block architecture is to decouple block speed and block size when allocating throughput improvements. Users want faster blocks for lower time to confirmation. Builders want larger blocks to include larger transactions such as more complex contract deployments. Instead of a forced tradeoff, the dual-block system will allow simultaneous improvement along both axes.

The HyperEVM "mempool" is still onchain state with respect to the umbrella L1 execution, but is split into two independent mempools that source transactions for the two block types. The two block types are interleaved with a unique increasing sequence of EVM block numbers. The onchain mempool implementation accepts only the next 8 nonces for each address. Transactions older than 1 day old in the mempool are pruned.

The initial configuration is set conservatively, and throughput is expected to increase over successive technical upgrades. Fast block duration is set to 1 seconds with a 2M gas limit. Slow block duration is set to 1 minute with a 30M gas limit.

More precisely, in the definitions above, _block duration_ of `x` means that the first L1 block for each value of `l1_block_time % x` produces an EVM block.

Developers can deploy larger contracts as follows:

1. Submit action `{"type": "evmUserModify", "usingBigBlocks": true}` to direct HyperEVM transactions to big blocks instead of small blocks. Note that this user state flag is set on the HyperCore user level, and must be unset again to target small blocks. Like any action, this requires an existing Core user to send. Like any EOA, the deployer address can be converted to a Core user by receiving a Core asset such as USDC.

2. Optionally use the JSON-RPC method `bigBlockGasPrice` in place of `gasPrice` to estimate base gas fee on the next big block.

Introduction

Spot assets can be sent between HyperCore and the HyperEVM. In the context of these transfers, spot assets on HyperCore are called `Core spot` while ones on the EVM are called `EVM spot`. The spot deployer can link their Core spot asset to any ERC20 contract deployed to the EVM. The Core spot asset and ERC20 token can be deployed in either order.

As the native token on HyperCore, HYPE also links to the native HyperEVM balance rather than an ERC20 contract.

As the native token on HyperCore, HYPE also links to the native HyperEVM balance rather than an ERC20 contract.
##

System Addresses

Every token has a system address on the Core, which is the address with first byte `0x20` and the remaining bytes all zeros, except for the token index encoded in big-endian format. For example, for token index 200, the system address would be `0x20000000000000000000000000000000000000c8` .

The exception is HYPE, which has a system address of `0x2222222222222222222222222222222222222222` .

le, for token index 200, the system address would be `0x20000000000000000000000000000000000000c8` .

The exception is HYPE, which has a system address of `0x2222222222222222222222222222222222222222` .
##

Transferring HYPE

HYPE is a special case as the native gas token on the HyperEVM. HYPE is received on the EVM side of a transfer as the native gas token instead of an ERC20 token. To transfer back to HyperCore, HYPE can be sent as a transaction value. The EVM transfer address `0x222..2` is a system contract that emits `event Received(address indexed user, uint256 amount)` as its payable `receive()` function. Here `user` is `msg.sender`, so this implementation enables both smart contracts and EOAs to transfer HYPE back to HyperCore. Note that there is a small gas cost to emitting this log on the EVM side.

##

Transferring between Core and EVM

Only once a token is linked, it can be converted between HyperCore and HyperEVM spot using a spotSend action (or via the frontend) and on the EVM by using an ERC20 transfer.

Transferring tokens from HyperCore to HyperEVM can be done using a spotSend action (or via the frontend) with the corresponding system address as the destination. The tokens are credited by a system transaction that calls `transfer(recipient, amount)` on the linked contract as the system address, where recipient is the sender of the spotSend action.

Transferring tokens from HyperEVM to HyperCore can be done using an ERC20 transfer with the corresponding system address as the destination. The tokens are credited to the Core based on the emitted `Transfer(address from, address to, uint256 value)` from the linked contract.

Do not blindly assume accurate fungibility between Core and EVM spot. See [Caveats](/hyperliquid-docs/for-developers/hyperevm/hypercore-less-than-greater-than-hyperevm-transfers#caveats) for more details.

Gas costs

A transfer from HyperEVM to HyperCore costs similar gas to the equivalent transfer of the ERC20 token or HYPE to any other address on the HyperEVM that has an existing balance.

A transfer from HyperCore to HyperEVM costs 200k gas at the base gas price of the next HyperEVM block.

##

Linking Core and EVM Spot Assets

In order for transfers between Core spot and EVM spot to work the token's system address must have the total non-system balance on the other side. For example, to deploy an ERC20 contract for an existing Core spot asset, the system contract should have the entirety of the EVM spot supply equal to the max Core spot supply. Once this is done the spot deployer needs to send a spot deploy action to link the token to the EVM:

Copy
    
    
    /**
     * @param token - The token index to link
     * @param address - The address of the ERC20 contract on the evm.
     * @param evmExtraWeiDecimals - The difference in Wei decimals between Core and EVM spot. E.g. Core PURR has 5 weiDecimals but EVM PURR has 18, so this would be 13. evmExtraWeiDecimals should be in the range [-2, 18] inclusive
     */
    interface RequestEvmContract {
      type: “requestEvmContract”;
      token: number;
      Address: address;
      evmExtraWeiDecimals: number;
    }

After sending this action, HyperCore will store the pending EVM address to be linked. The deployer of the EVM contract must then verify their intention to link to the HyperCore token in one of two ways:

1. If the EVM contract was deployed from an EOA, the EVM user can send an action using the nonce that was used to deploy the EVM contract.

2. If the EVM contract was deployed by another contract (e.g. create2 via a multisig), the contract's first storage slot or slot at keccak256("HyperCore deployer") must store the address of a finalizer user.

To finalize the link, the finalizer user sends the following action (note that this not nested in a spot deploy action). In the "create" case, the EVM deployer sends the action. In the "firstStorageSlot" or "customStorageSlot" case, the finalizer must match the value in the corresponding slot.

Caveats

There are currently no checks that the system address has sufficient supply or that the contract is a valid ERC20, so be careful when sending funds.

In particular, the linked contract may have arbitrary bytecode, so it's prudent to verify that its implementation is correct. There are no guarantees about what the `transfer` call does on the EVM, so make sure to verify the source code and total balance of the linked EVM contract.

If the EVM contract has extra Wei decimals, then if the relevant log emitted has a value that is not round (does not end in `extraEvmWeiDecimals` zeros), the non-round amount is burned (guaranteed to be <1 Wei). This is true for both HYPE and any other spot tokens.

Mainnet PURR

Mainnet PURR is deployed as an ERC20 contract at `0x9b498C3c8A0b8CD8BA1D9851d40D186F1872b44E `with the following code. It will be linked to PURR on HyperCore once linking is enabled on mainnet.

Read precompiles

The testnet EVM provides read precompiles that allows querying HyperCore information. The precompile addresses start at 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000800 and have methods for querying information such as perps positions, spot balances, vault equity, staking delegations, oracle prices, and the L1 block number.

The values are guaranteed to match the latest HyperCore state at the time the EVM block is constructed.

Attached is a Solidity file `L1Read.sol` describing the read precompiles. As an example, this call queries the third perp oracle price on testnet:

Copy
    
    
    cast call 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000807 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000003 --rpc-url https://rpc.hyperliquid-testnet.xyz/evm

To convert to floating point numbers, divide the returned price by `10^(6 - szDecimals)`for perps and `10^(8 - base asset szDecimals)` for spot.

Precompiles called on invalid inputs such as invalid assets or vault address will return an error and consume all gas passed into the precompile call frame. Precompiles have a gas cost of `2000 + 65 * output_len`.

CoreWriter contract

A system contract is available at 0x3333333333333333333333333333333333333333 for sending transactions from the HyperEVM to HyperCore. It burns ~25,000 gas before emitting a log to be processed by HyperCore as an action. In practice the gas usage for a basic call will be ~47000. A solidity file `CoreWriter.sol` for the write system contract is attached.

Action encoding details

* Byte 1: Encoding version

* Currently, only version `1` is supported, but enables future upgrades while maintaining backward compatibility.

* Bytes 2-4: Action ID

* These three bytes, when decoded as a big-endian unsigned integer, represent the unique identifier for the action.

* Remaining bytes: Action encoding

* The rest of the bytes constitue the action-specific data. It is always the raw ABI encoding of a sequence of Solidity types

To prevent any potential latency advantages for using HyperEVM to bypass the L1 mempool, order actions and vault transfers sent from CoreWriter are delayed onchain for a few seconds. This has no noticeable effect on UX because the end user has to wait for at least one small block confirmation. These onchain-delayed actions appear twice in the L1 explorer: first as an enqueuing and second as a HyperCore execution.

            bytes memory encodedAction = abi.encode(ntl, toPerp);
            bytes memory data = new bytes(4 + encodedAction.length);
            data[0] = 0x01;
            data[1] = 0x00;
            data[2] = 0x00;
            data[3] = 0x07;
            for (uint256 i = 0; i < encodedAction.length; i++) {
                data[4 + i] = encodedAction[i];
            }
            CoreWriter(0x3333333333333333333333333333333333333333).sendRawAction(data);
        }

Transfer Timing

Transfers from HyperCore to HyperEVM are queued on the L1 until the next HyperEVM block. Transfers from HyperEVM to HyperCore happen in the same L1 block as the HyperEVM block, immediately after the HyperEVM block is built.

##

Timing within a HyperEVM block

On an L1 block that produces a HyperEVM block:

1. L1 block is built

2. EVM block is built

3. EVM -> Core transfers are processed

4. CoreWriter actions are processed

# Raw HyperEVM block data

Builders running a non-validating node can index the HyperEVM using data written to `~/hl/data/evm_block_and_receipts` . This data is written after committed blocks are verified by the node, and therefore has no additional trust assumptions compared to running the EVM RPC directly from the node itself.

Builders that wish to index the HyperEVM without running a node can use the S3 bucket: `aws s3 ls s3://hl-mainnet-evm-blocks/ --request-payer requester`.

There is a similar bucket `s3://hl-testnet-evm-blocks/` for testnet.

Builders interested in robustness can merge the two data sources, relying primarily on local data and falling back to S3 data.

Some potential applications include a JSON-RPC server with custom rate limits, a HyperEVM block explorer, or other indexed services and tooling for builders.

While the data is public for anyone to use, the requester must pay for data transfer costs. The filenames are predictably indexed by EVM block number, e.g. `s3://hl-mainnet-evm-blocks/0/6000/6123.rmp.lz4.` An indexer can copy block data from S3 on new HyperEVM blocks. The files are stored in MessagePack format and then compressed using LZ4.

Note that testnet starts with directory `s3://hl-testnet-evm-blocks/18000000`and the earlier testnet RPC blocks were not backfilled.

An example can be found in the Python SDK: <https://github.com/hyperliquid-dex/hyperliquid-python-sdk/blob/master/examples/evm_block_indexer.py>[](https://github.com/hyperliquid-dex/hyperliquid-python-sdk/blob/master/examples/evm_block_indexer.py)

# Foundation non-validating node
###

Overview

The Hyper Foundation runs a non-validating node to provide reliable, low latency data access. As a reminder, running a non-validating node is permissionless. This non-validating node is available for those who would benefit from a reliable peer with fewer hops to validating nodes.

The Foundation non-validating node is made available on a best-efforts basis to support access to publicly available data on the Hyperliquid blockchain. No guarantees are made regarding availability, latency, performance, or data completeness, and the node should not be relied upon as a sole or authoritative source of data for any trading or time-sensitive activity. Users connecting to the Foundation non-validating node are solely responsible for verifying any data received and for operating their own infrastructure if needed. Access may be modified, rate-limited, or discontinued at any time without notice.

The Foundation non-validating node runs in apne1-az1 on AWS.

Potential use cases

Automated traders can run a non-validating node pointing to the Foundation non-validating node. The local non-validating node can record fills and orders with output file buffering disabled for real-time streaming data. A local API server can also be pointed at this local non-validating node to provide real-time API data.

The node writes data to `~/hl/data`. With default settings, the network will generate around 100 GB of logs per day, so it is recommended to archive or delete old files.

The command line flags to generate the auxiliary data below can be found at <https://github.com/hyperliquid-dex/node>[](https://github.com/hyperliquid-dex/node)

L4 snapshots

Given an abci state, the node can compute an L4 book snapshot, which is the entire order book with full information about the orders for each level. This can be used as a checkpoint upon which the order statuses stream may be applied, allowing users to stream an L4 book in realtime.

Orders in the snapshot are sorted in time-order at the same price level. Trigger orders come at the end and be differentiated with `isTrigger` .

# API servers

API servers listen to updates from a node and maintains the blockchain state locally. The API server serves information about this state and also forwards user transactions to the node. The API serves two sources of data, REST and Websocket.

When user transactions are sent to an API server, they are forwarded to the connected node, which then gossips the transaction as part of the HyperBFT consensus algorithm. Once the transaction has been included in a committed block on the L1, the API server responds to the original request with the execution response from the L1.

# Bridge

Deposits to the bridge are signed by the validators and are credited when more than 2/3 of the staking power has signed the deposit.

Withdrawals from Hyperliquid are immediately deducted from the L1 balance, and validators sign the withdrawal as separate transactions. When 2/3 of the staking power has signed the withdrawal, an EVM transaction can be sent to the bridge to request the withdrawal.

After a withdrawal is requested, there is a dispute period during which the bridge can be locked for a malicious withdrawal that does not match the Hyperliquid state. Cold wallet signatures of 2/3 of the stake-weighted validator set are required to unlock the bridge.

After the dispute period, finalization transactions are sent, which distribute the USDC to the corresponding destination addresses. There is a similar mechanism to maintain the set of active validators and their corresponding stake on the bridge contract.

Withdrawals do not require any Arbitrum ETH from the user. Instead, a withdrawal gas fee of 1 USDC is paid by the user on Hyperliquid to cover the Arbitrum gas costs of the validators.

The bridge and its logic in relation to the L1 staking have been audited by Zellic. See the Hyperliquid Github repository for the full bridge code, and the [Audits](/hyperliquid-docs/audits) section for the audit reports.

# Clearinghouse

The perps clearinghouse is a component of the execution state on HyperCore. It manages the perps margin state for each address, which includes balance and positions.

Deposits are first credited to an address's cross margin balance. Positions by default are also opened in cross margin mode. Isolated margin is also supported, which allows users to allocate margin towards a specific position, disassociating the liquidation risk of that position with all other positions.

The spot clearinghouse analogously manages spot user state for each address, including token balances and holds.

# Multi-sig

Advanced Feature

HyperCore supports native multi-sig actions. This allows multiple private keys to control a single account for additional security. Unlike other chains, multi-sig is available as a built-in primitive on HyperCore as opposed to relying on smart contracts.

The multi-sig workflow is described below:

* To convert a user to a multi-sig user, the user sends a `ConvertToMultiSigUser` action with the authorized users and the minimum required number of authorized users required to sign an action. Authorized users must be existing users on Hyperliquid. Once a user has been converted into a multi-sig user, all its actions must be sent via multi-sig.

* To send an action, each authorized user must sign a payload to produce a signature. A `MultiSig` action wraps around any normal action and includes a list of signatures from authorized users.

* The `MutiSig` payload also contains the target multi-sig user and the authorized user who will ultimately send the `MultiSig` action to the blockchain. The sender of the final action is also known as the `leader` (transaction lead address) of the multi-sig action.

* When a multi-sig action is sent, only the nonce set of the authorized user who sent the transaction is validated and updated.

* Similarly to normal actions, the leader can also be an API wallet of an authorized user. In this case, the nonce of the API wallet is checked and updated.

* A multi-sig user's set of authorized users and/or the threshold may be updated by sending a `MultiSig` action wrapping a`ConvertToMultiSigUser` action describing the new state.

* A multi-sig user can be converted back to a normal user by sending a `ConvertToMultiSigUser` via multi-sig. In this case, the set of authorized users can be set to empty and conversion to normal user will be performed.

Miscellaneous notes:

* The leader (transaction lead address) must be an authorized user, not the multi-sig account

thorized users can be set to empty and conversion to normal user will be performed.

Miscellaneous notes:

* The leader (transaction lead address) must be an authorized user, not the multi-sig account
* Each signature must use the same information, e.g., same nonce, transaction lead address, etc.

* The leader must collect all signatures before submitting the action

* A user can be a multi-sig user and an authorized user for another multi-sig user at the same time. A user may be an authorized user for multiple multi-sig users. The maximum allowed number of authorized users for a given multi-sig user is 10.

Important for HyperEVM users: Converting a user to a multi-sig still leaves the HyperEVM user controllable by the original wallet. CoreWriter does not work for multi-sig users. In general, multi-sig users should not interact with the HyperEVM before or after conversion.

See the Python SDK for code examples.

# Oracle

The validators are responsible for publishing spot oracle prices for each perp asset every 3 seconds. The oracle prices are used to compute funding rates. They are also a component in the `mark price` which is used for margining, liquidations, and triggering TP/SL orders.

The spot oracle prices are computed by each validator as the weighted median of Binance, OKX, Bybit, Kraken, Kucoin, Gate IO, MEXC, and Hyperliquid spot prices for each asset, with weights 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 respectively. Perps on assets which have primary spot liquidity on Hyperliquid (e.g. HYPE) do not include external sources in the oracle until sufficient liquidity is met. Perps on assets that have primary spot liquidity outside of Hyperliquid (e.g. BTC) do not include Hyperliquid spot prices in the oracle.

The final oracle price used by the clearinghouse is the weighted median of each validator's submitted oracle prices, where the validators are weighted by their stake.

# Order book

HyperCore state includes an order book for each asset. The order book works in similarly to centralized exchanges. Orders are added where price is an integer multiple of the tick size, and size is an integer multiple of lot size. Orders are matched in price-time priority.

Operations on order books for perp assets take a reference to the clearinghouse, as all positions and margin checks are handled there. Margin checks happen on the opening of a new order, and again for the resting side at the matching of each order. This ensures that the margining system is consistent despite oracle price fluctuations after the resting order is placed.

One unique aspect of the Hyperliquid L1 is that the mempool and consensus logic are semantically aware of transactions that interact with HyperCore order books. Within a block, actions are sorted

1. Actions that do not send GTC or IOC orders to any book

2. Cancels

3. Actions that send at least one GTC or IOC

Within each category, actions are sorted in the order they were proposed by the block proposer. Modifies are categorized according to the new order they place.

Execution

The Hyperliquid state is comprised of HyperCore and the general purpose HyperEVM.

HyperCore include margin and matching engine state. Importantly, HyperCore does not rely on the crutch of off-chain order books. A core design principle is full decentralization with one consistent order of transactions achieved through HyperBFT consensus.

###

Latency

Consensus currently uses an optimized consensus algorithm called HyperBFT, which is optimized for end-to-end latency. End-to-end latency is measured as duration between sending request to receiving committed response.

For an order placed from a geographically co-located client, end-to-end latency has a median 0.2 seconds and 99th percentile 0.9 seconds. This performance allows users to port over automated strategies from other crypto venues with minimal changes and gives retail users instant feedback through the UI.

###

Throughput

Mainnet currently supports approximately 200k orders/sec. The current bottleneck is execution. The consensus algorithm and networking stack can scale to millions of orders per second once the execution can keep up. There are plans to further optimize the execution logic once the need arises.

Basics

HYPE staking on Hyperliquid happens within HyperCore. Just as USDC can be transferred between perps and spot accounts, HYPE can be transferred between spot and staking accounts.

Within the staking account, HYPE may be staked to any number of validators. Here and in other docs, _delegate_ and _stake_ are used interchangeably, as Hyperliquid only supports delegated proof of stake.

Each validator has a self-delegation requirement of 10000 HYPE to become active. Once active, validators produce blocks and receive rewards proportional to their total delegated stake. Validators may charge a commission to their delegators. This commission cannot be increased unless the new commission is less than or equal to 1%. This prevents scenarios where a validator attracts a large amount of stake and then raises the commission significantly to take advantage of unaware stakers.

Delegations to a particular validator have a lockup duration of 1 day. After this lockup, delegations may be partially or fully undelegated at any time. Undelegated balances instantly reflect in staking account balance.

Transfers from spot account to staking account are instant. However, transfers from staking account to spot account have a 7 day unstaking queue. Most other proof of stake chains have a similar mechanism, which ensures that large-scale consensus attacks are penalized by slashing or social layer mechanisms. There is currently no automatic slashing implemented.

As an example, if you initiate a staking to spot transfer of 100 HYPE at 08:00:00 UTC on March 11 and a transfer of 50 HYPE at 09:00:00 UTC on March 12, the 100 HYPE transfer will be finalized at 08:00:01 UTC on March 18 and the 50 HYPE transfer will be finalized at 09:00:01 UTC on March 19.

ch 11 and a transfer of 50 HYPE at 09:00:00 UTC on March 12, the 100 HYPE transfer will be finalized at 08:00:01 UTC on March 18 and the 50 HYPE transfer will be finalized at 09:00:01 UTC on March 19.
The staking reward rate formula is inspired by Ethereum, where the reward rate is inversely proportional to the square root of total HYPE staked. At 400M total HYPE staked, the yearly reward rate is approximately 2.37% per year. Staking rewards come from the future emissions reserve.

Rewards are accrued every minute and distributed to stakers every day. Rewards are redelegated automatically to the staked validator, i.e. compounded. Rewards are based on the minimum balance that a delegator has staked during each staking epoch (100k rounds, as explained below).

###

Technical Details

The notion of a _quorum_ is essential to modern proof of stake consensus algorithms such as HyperBFT. A quorum is any set of validators that has more than ⅔ of the total stake in the network. The operating requirement of consensus is that a quorum of stake is honest (non-Byzantine). Therefore it is an essential responsibility of every staker to only delegate to trusted validators.

HyperBFT consensus proceeds in _rounds_ , which is a fundamental discrete bundle of transactions along with signatures from a quorum of validators. Each _round_ may be _committed_ after certain conditions are met, after which it is sent to the execution state for processing. A key property of the consensus algorithm is that all honest nodes agree on the ordered list of committed rounds.

Rounds may result in a new execution state block. Execution blocks are indexed by a separate increasing counter called _height_. Height only increments on consensus rounds with at least one transaction.

The validator set evolves in epochs of 100k rounds, which is approximately 90 minutes on mainnet. The validators and consensus stakes are static for each staking epoch.

Validators may vote to jail peers that do not respond with adequate latency or frequency to the consensus messages of the voter. Upon receiving a quorum of jail votes, a validator becomes _jailed_ and no longer participates in consensus. A jailed validator does not produce rewards for its delegators. A validator may unjail themselves by diagnosing and fixing the causes, subject to onchain unjailing rate limits. Note that jailing is not the same slashing, which is reserved for provably malicious behavior such as double-signing blocks at the same round.

# Vaults

Vaults are a powerful and flexible primitive built into HyperCore. Strategies running on vaults benefit from the same advanced features as the DEX, from liquidations of overleveraged accounts to high throughput market making strategies. No more depositing into vaults that simply rebalance two tokens.

Anyone can deposit into a vault to earn a share of the profits. In exchange, the vault owner receives 10% of the total profits. (Note that protocol vaults do not have any fees or profit share). Vaults can be managed by an individual trader or automated by a market maker. All strategies come with their own risk, and users should carefully assess the risks and performance history of a vault before depositing.

What are the benefits of depositing into a vault?

By depositing, you earn a share of the profits, or losses, of the vault. If there are specific traders you admire or support, you can deposit into their vault to get exposure to their trading strategies.

Let’s say you deposit 100 USDC into a vault, whose total deposits are 900 USDC. The vault total is now 1,000 USDC, and you represent 10% of the vault. Over time, the vault grows to be 2,000 USDC, while no one else has deposited or withdrawn from the vault. You withdraw 200 USDC (10%) less 10 USDC (10% profit share to the leader), which totals 190 USDC. There may be some slippage as you withdraw and open positions are closed.

Note that trading is inherently risky, and vaults’ past performance is not a guarantee of future returns.

###

What happens to open positions in a vault when someone withdraws?

When someone withdraws from a vault, if there is enough margin to keep the open positions according to the leverages set, the withdrawal does not affect open positions.

If there is not enough margin available, open orders that are using margin will be canceled. Orders will be canceled in increasing order of margin used.

If there is still not enough margin available, 20% of positions are automatically closed. This is repeated until enough margin is freed up such that the user's withdrawal can be processed. Vault leaders can also set vaults to always proportionally close positions on withdrawals to maintain similar liquidation prices for positions.

Hyperliquidity Provider (HLP) is a protocol vault that does market making and liquidations and receives a portion of trading fees.

HLP democratizes strategies typically reserved for privileged parties on other exchanges. The community can provide liquidity for the vault and share its pnl. HLP is fully community-owned.

The deposit lock-up period is 4 days. This means you can withdraw 4 days after your most recent deposit. E.g., if you deposited on Sep 14 at 08:00, you would be able to withdraw on Sep 18 at 08:00.

###

Why build on the HyperEVM?

Builders can plug into a mature, liquid, and performant onchain order books with HyperCore + HyperEVM on Hyperliquid. In addition, Hyperliquid has a captive audience of users who want to be at the forefront of financial change; they are excited to try new applications and conduct finance onchain. See the [HyperEVM developer section](/hyperliquid-docs/for-developers/hyperevm) for more technical details and [tools for HyperEVM builders](/hyperliquid-docs/hyperevm/tools-for-hyperevm-builders) for resources.

As one example, a project XYZ could deploy an ERC20 contract on the HyperEVM using standard EVM tooling and deploy a corresponding spot asset XYZ permissionlessly in the HyperCore spot auction. Once the HyperCore token and HyperEVM contract are linked, users can use the same XYZ token on HyperEVM applications and trade it with on the native spot order book. This has two key improvements compared to CEX listings: 1) The entire process is permissionless, with no behind-the-scenes negotiations for preferential treatment and 2) There is no bridging risk between HyperCore and HyperEVM as one unified state. Trading and building on the same chain is a 10x product improvement over CEXs.

tiations for preferential treatment and 2) There is no bridging risk between HyperCore and HyperEVM as one unified state. Trading and building on the same chain is a 10x product improvement over CEXs.
As another example, a lending protocol could set up a pool contract that accepts token XYZ as collateral and lends out another token ABC to the borrower. To determine the liquidation threshold, the lending smart contract can read XYZ/ABC prices directly from the HyperCore order books using a read precompile. For a Solidity developer, this is as simple as calling a built-in function. Suppose the borrower's position requires liquidation. The lending smart contract can send orders directly swapping XYZ and ABC on the HyperCore order books using a write system contract. Again, this is a simple built-in function in Solidity. In a few lines of code, the lending protocol has implemented protocolized liquidations similar to how perps function on HyperCore. A theme of the HyperEVM is to abstract away the deep liquidity on HyperCore as a building block for arbitrary user applications.

###

What stage is the HyperEVM in?

The HyperEVM is in the alpha stage. There are three reasons behind this gradual roll-out approach.

First, this stays true to Hyperliquid’s “no insiders” principle; everyone has equal access and starts on a level playing field. The tradeoff is that HyperEVM did not launch with the same tooling you might see on other chains, since no one is given a heads up nor paid for an integration or marketing. These short term obstacles are worth it to be a fair, credibly neutral platform in the long-run.

Second, a gradual roll-out is the safest way to upgrade a complex system doing billions of dollars of volume a day and protect against performance degradation or downtime.

Third, shipping an MVP and iterating live with user feedback allows development to adjust more nimbly. Testnets are useful for technical testing, but systems can only be hardened through real economic use.

As such, higher throughput and write system contracts are not live on mainnet yet, but will be in due time.

There are many ways to reach invalid configurations during the spot deploy process. To avoid this, deployers can try intended deployments on testnet first. For automated deployment integrations, the following is a list of client-side checks that may be helpful.

# HIP-1: Native token standard

HIP-1 is a capped supply fungible token standard. It also features onchain spot order books between pairs of HIP-1 tokens.

The sender of the token genesis transaction will specify the following:

1. `name`: human readable, maximum 6 characters, no uniqueness constraints.

2. `weiDecimals`: the conversion rate from the minimal integer unit of the token to a human-interpretable float. For example, ETH on EVM networks has `weiDecimals = 18` and BTC on Bitcoin network has `weiDecimals = 8`.

3. `szDecimals`: the minimum tradable number of decimals on spot order books. In other words, the lot size of the token on all spot order books will be `10 ** (weiDecimals - szDecimals)`. It is required that `szDecimals + 5 <= weiDecimals`.

4. `maxSupply`: the maximum and initial supply. The supply may decrease over time due to spot order book fees or future burn mechanisms.

5. `initialWei`: optional genesis balances specified by the sender of the transaction. This could include a multisig treasury, an initial bridge mint, etc.

6. `anchorTokenWei` the sender of the transaction can specify existing HIP-1 tokens to proportionally receieve genesis balances.

7. `hyperliquidityInit`: parameters for initializing the Hyperliquidity for the USDC spot pair. See HIP-2 section for more details.

The deployment transaction of the token will generate a globally unique hash by which the execution logic will index the token.

###

Gas cost for deployment

Like all transactions, gas costs will ultimately be paid in the native Hyperliquid token. Currently, the following gas cost is in HYPE.

1. The gas cost of deployment is decided through a dutch auction with duration 31 hours. In this period, the deployment gas decreases linearly from `initial_price` to `500 HYPE` . The initial price is `500 HYPE` if the last auction failed to complete, otherwise 2 times the last gas price.

2. Genesis to existing anchor tokens holders are proportional to `balance - 1e-6 * anchorTokenMaxSupply`at the time of the deployed token's genesis. If this value is negative, no genesis tokens are received. In particular, this means genesis holders must hold at least 0.0001% of the anchor token's max supply at genesis to be included in the deployed token's genesis.

3. Potential workaround for constraint (2): a small initial USDC gas fee (value TBD) for the initial state update of each `(address, token)` pair, either through trading or transfer. Further trades and transfers to initialized ledgers are gas free within the standard Hyperliquid fill rate conditions.

state update of each `(address, token)` pair, either through trading or transfer. Further trades and transfers to initialized ledgers are gas free within the standard Hyperliquid fill rate conditions.
###

IMPORTANT GAS DETAILS:

The only time-sensitive step of the process is the very first step of deploying the token, where the deployer specifies name, szDecimals, and weiDecimals. This step is when the gas is charged and the token is locked in. It is recommended to take all the necessary time after this step to reduce errors. There is no time limit once the gas is paid.

Deployment is a complex multi-stage process, and it is possible to get in a state where your deployment is stuck. For example, Hyperliquidity and total supply may be incompatible. It is the deployer's responsibility to try the exact deployment on testnet first: <https://app.hyperliquid-testnet.xyz/deploySpot>[](https://app.hyperliquid-testnet.xyz/deploySpot). Gas cannot be refunded if the deployment is stuck.

###

USDC

USDC is currently used for all perps margining. With HIP-1, USDC also becomes a spot token with an atomic transfer between perps and spot wallet USDC. Spot USDC has `szDecimals = weiDecimals = 8` to allow for a wide range of HIP-1 token prices.

###

Spot trading

HIP-1 tokens trade on order books parametrized by `base` and `quote` tokens, where limit orders are commitments to exchange `sz * 10 ** (weiDecimalsBase - szDecimalsBase)` units of the base token for `px * sz * 10 ** (weiDecimalsQuote - szDecimalsQuote)` units of the quote token. Any HIP-1 token will be initialized with a native spot order book where the quote token is Spot USDC. Trading of arbitrary pairs of native tokens can be enabled in the future.

###

Trading fees

Native spot and perps order books share the same volume-based fee schedule for each address. Fees collected in non-USDC HIP-1 native tokens are sent to the deployer, i.e. the deployer's fee share defaults to 100%. The base token deployer can set this percentage in the range of [0, 100%] but only lower than the previous value afterwards. The portion of base token fees that is not redirected to the deployer is burned. For other quote tokens besides USDC, the fees are sent to the reserve accumulator. Quote token deployers cannot configure a trading fee share.

###

Spot dust conversion

Spot dusting occurs once a day at 00:00 UTC. All spot balances that are less than 1 lot size with notional value <= 1 USD will be dusted. Here, the notional value is computed as the prevailing mid price of the token against USDC, times the token balance. All users’ dust across a token is aggregated, and a market sell order is automatically submitted to the book. If the aggregate dust is smaller than one lot size, then that dust is burned. Otherwise, the USDC from the successfully converted dust will be allocated back to all dusted users on a weighted basis, where the weighting is equal to the user’s fraction of the aggregate dust.

Dusting will not occur if 1) the book is one-sided or 2) the amount of notional dust is too high such that the book would be impacted by this operation. For PURR, this is 10000 USDC; for all other tokens, this is 3000 USDC. Note: the amount of USDC received may be less than the notional amount computed from the mid because of slippage incurred while dusting or if there was insufficient liquidity to convert the total dust across all users.

# HIP-2: Hyperliquidity
###

Motivation

Though HIP-1 is sufficient as a permissionless token standard, in practice it is often crucial to bootstrap liquidity. One of Hyperliquid's core design principles is that liquidity should be democratized. For perps trading, HLP can quote deep and tight liquidity based on CEX perp and spot prices, but a new model is needed for HIP-1 tokens that are in early phases of price discovery.

Hyperliquidity is inspired by Uniswap, while interoperating with a native onchain order book to support sophisticated order book liquidity from end users. HIP-2 is a fully decentralized onchain strategy that is part of Hyperliquid's block transition logic. Unlike conventional automated order book strategies, there are no operators. The strategy logic is secured by the same consensus that operates the order book itself. Note that Hyperliquidity is currently only available on spot pairs against USDC.

Hyperliquidity is parametrized by

1. `spot`: a spot order book asset with USDC quote returned by a deployment of HIP-1

2. `startPx`: the initial price of the range

3. `nOrders`: the number of orders in the range

4. `orderSz`: the size of a full order in the range

5. `nSeededLevels`: the number of levels that begin as bids instead of asks. Note that for each additional bid level added by incrementing `nSeededLevels` the deployer needs to fund Hyperliquidity with `px * sz` worth of USDC. For fixed `nOrders`, increasing seeded levels decreases the total supply because it reduces the genesis supply of Hyperliquidity.

Each Hyperliquidity strategy has a price range defined recursively `px_0 = startPx`, `px_i = round(px_{i-1} * 1.003)`. The strategy updates on every block where the block time is at least 3 seconds since the previous update block. After each update:

fined recursively `px_0 = startPx`, `px_i = round(px_{i-1} * 1.003)`. The strategy updates on every block where the block time is at least 3 seconds since the previous update block. After each update:
1. Strategy targets `nFull = floor(balance / orderSz)` full ask orders and a `balance % orderSz` partial ask order if the partial order is nonzero. To the extent that ALO orders are not rejected, these orders are ensured.

2. Each fully filled tranche is modified to an order of side `orderSz` on the side with available balance, with the exception of the single partial order from (1) if it exists.

The resulting strategy guarantees a 0.3% spread every 3 seconds. Like smart-contract based pools on general purpose chains, Hyperliquidity requires no maintenance in the form of user transactions. One key improvement is that Hyperliquidity participates in a general purpose order book. Active liquidity providers can join in liquidity provision alongside Hyperliquidity at any time, allowing markets to adapt to increasing demand for liquidity.

Advanced feature: Testnet-only

The Hyperliquid protocol will support builder-deployed perps (HIP-3), a key milestone toward fully decentralizing the perp listing process. An MVP of this feature is live on testnet. Feedback is appreciated during this testing phase. Note that numbers and specifications below are not finalized. Builder-deployed perps share many features with HyperCore spot deployments:

1. Deployments allocate new performant onchain orderbooks on HyperCore.

2. Deployment gas in HYPE is paid through a Dutch auction every 31 hours. There is a single Dutch auction across all HIP-3 perp DEXs.

3. Deployers can set a fee share of up to 50%. A difference is that the deployer can configure additional fees on top of the base fee rate. Fee share applies to the total configured fee. The fee share configuration transaction for deployers will be documented once live on testnet.

4. Deployments are fully permissionless.

The deployer of a perp market is also responsible for

1. Market definition, including the oracle definition and contract specifications

2. Market operation, including setting oracle prices, leverage limits, and settling the market if needed

Perp deployment composes with HyperCore multisig to support protocolized market deployment and operation.

To ensure high quality markets and protect users, deployers must maintain 1M staked HYPE. In the event of malicious market operation, validators have the authority to slash the deployer’s stake by conducting a stake-weighted vote during the deployer’s 7-day unstaking queue.

##

Settlement

The deployer may settle an asset using the `haltTrading` action. This cancels all orders and settles positions to the current mark price. The same action can be used to resume trading, effectively recycling the asset. This could be used to list dated contracts without participating in the deployment auction for each new contract.

Once all assets are settled, a deployer's required stake is free to be unstaked.

Once all assets are settled, a deployer's required stake is free to be unstaked.
##

Oracle

While the oracle is completely general at the protocol level, perps make the most mathematical sense when there is a well-defined underlying asset or data feed which is difficult to manipulate and has underlying economic significance. Most price indices are not amenable as perp oracle sources. Deployers should consider edge cases carefully before listing markets, as they are subject to slashing for all listed markets on their DEX.

##

Open interest caps

Builder-deployed perp markets are subject to two types of open interest caps: notional (sum of absolute position size times mark price) and size (sum of absolute position sizes).

Notional open interest caps are enforced on the total open interest summed over all assets within the DEX, as well as per-asset. Perp deployers can set a custom open interest cap per asset, which is documented in <https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/for-developers/api/hip-3-deployer-actions>[](https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/for-developers/api/hip-3-deployer-actions).

Size-denominated open interest caps are only enforced per-asset. Size-denominated open interest caps are currently a constant 1B per asset, so a reasonable default would be to set `szDecimals` such that the minimal size increment is $1-10 at the initial mark price.

What do I need to trade on Hyperliquid?

You can trade on Hyperliquid with a normal defi wallet or by logging in with your email address.

If you choose to use a normal defi wallet, you need:

1. An EVM wallet

* If you don’t already have an EVM wallet (e.g., Rabby, MetaMask, WalletConnect, Coinbase Wallet), you can set one up easily at <https://rabby.io/>[](https://rabby.io/).

* After downloading a wallet extension for your browser, create a new wallet.

* Your wallet has a secret recovery phrase – anyone with access to your password or seed phrase can access your funds. Do not share your private key with anyone. Best practice is to record your seed phrase and store it in a safe physical location.

2. Collateral

* USDC and ETH (gas to deposit) on Arbitrum, or

* BTC on Bitcoin, ETH on Ethereum, or SOL/BONK/FARTCOIN/PUMP/SPX on Solana, which can be traded for USDC on Hyperliquid

###

How do I onboard to Hyperliquid?

There are many different interfaces and apps you can use, including

* [Based](https://based.one/) (web, iOS, Android)

* [Dexari](https://dexari.com/) (iOS, Android)

* [Lootbase](https://lootbase.com/) (iOS, Android)

* [Phantom](https://phantom.com/) (web extension, iOS, Android)

* [app.hyperliquid.xyz](https://app.hyperliquid.xyz/trade) (web)

If you choose to log in to app.hyperliquid.xyz with email:

1. Click the "Connect" button and enter your email address. After you press "Submit," within a few seconds, a 6 digit code will be sent to your email. Type in the 6 digit code to login.

2. Now you're connected. All that's left is to deposit. A new blockchain address is created for your email address. You can send USDC over Arbitrum, BTC over Bitcoin, ETH over Ethereum, or SOL/BONK/FARTCOIN/PUMP/SPX over Solana. It’s easy to do from a centralized exchange or another defi wallet.

If you choose to connect to app.hyperliquid.xyz with a defi wallet:

1. Click the “Connect” button and choose a wallet to connect. A pop-up will appear in your wallet extension asking you to connect to Hyperliquid. Press “Connect.”

2. Click the “Enable Trading” button. A pop-up will appear in your wallet extension asking you to sign a gas-less transaction. Press "Sign."

3. Deposit to Hyperliquid, choosing between USDC on Arbitrum, BTC on Bitcoin, ETH on Ethereum, and SOL/BONK/FARTCOIN/PUMP/SPX on Solana.

1. For USDC: enter the amount you want to deposit and click “Deposit.” Confirm the transaction in your EVM wallet.

2. For the others: send the spot asset to the destination address shown. Note that only USDC is used as trading collateral, so you will have to sell this asset for USDC to trade perpetuals or other spot assets.

How do I trade perpetuals on Hyperliquid?

With perpetual contracts, you use USDC as collateral to long or short the token instead of buying the token itself, like in spot trading.

1. Using the token selector, choose a token that you want to open a position in.

2. Decide if you want to long or short that token. If you expect the token price to go up, you want to long. If you expect the token price to go down, you want to short.

3. Use the slider or type in the size of your position. Position size = your leverage amount * your collateral

4. Lastly, click Place Order. Click Confirm in the modal that appears. You can check the “Don’t show this again” box so you don’t have to confirm each order in the future.

4. Lastly, click Place Order. Click Confirm in the modal that appears. You can check the “Don’t show this again” box so you don’t have to confirm each order in the future.
###

How do I bridge USDC onto Hyperliquid?

1. You will need ETH and USDC on the Arbitrum network, since Hyperliquid’s native bridge is between Hyperliquid and Arbitrum. ETH will only be used as gas for transactions to deposit USDC. Trading on Hyperliquid does not cost gas.

1. You can use various bridges, such as <https://bridge.arbitrum.io/>[](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/), <https://app.debridge.finance/>[](https://app.debridge.finance/), <https://swap.mayan.finance/>[](https://swap.mayan.finance/), <https://app.across.to/bridge?>[](https://app.across.to/bridge?), <https://routernitro.com/swap>[](https://routernitro.com/swap), <https://jumper.exchange/>[](https://jumper.exchange/), and <https://synapseprotocol.com/>[](https://synapseprotocol.com/)

2. Alternatively, you can move funds directly to Arbitrum from a centralized exchange, if you’re already using one.

2. Once you have ETH and USDC on Arbitrum, you can deposit by clicking the “Deposit” button on [https://app.hyperliquid.xyz/trade](https://hyperliquid.xyz/trade)

How do I move assets to and from the HyperEVM?

You can send assets to the HyperEVM from your Spot balances on HyperCore and vice versa by clicking the “Transfer to/from EVM” button on the Balances table of the Trade or Portfolio pages or clicking the "EVM <-> Core Transfer" button at the top of the Portfolio page.

You can also send your HYPE to 0x2222222222222222222222222222222222222222 from either your Spot balances or from the EVM to transfer. Note that this only works for HYPE; sending other assets will lead to them being lost. Each spot asset has a unique transfer address.

Sending from the HyperEVM to your Spot balances costs gas in HYPE on the HyperEVM. Sending from your Spot balances to the HyperEVM cost gas in HYPE on HyperCore (Spot).

###

How does the HyperEVM interact with the rest of the Hyperliquid blockchain?

Hyperliquid is one state with HyperCore state (e.g., perps, spot, order books, other trading features) and HyperEVM state. Because everything is secured by the same HyperBFT consensus, there will ultimately be seamless integration between the two. You can build an application on the HyperEVM involving lending, trading, yield generation, etc. That application can directly access the liquidity on the order books, so that defi has CEX-like functionality for the first time. The application token can also list on native Hyperliquid trading permissionlessly, so that trading happens on the same chain as building.

###

Why does gas spike?

While the Hyperliquid native blockchain is one of the most performant, high throughput blockchains today, the HyperEVM was intentionally launched with lower initial throughput. Because HyperCore and the HyperEVM share the same state, it is technically risky to allow the HyperEVM to consume more bandwidth on initial launch. The HyperEVM throughput will be increased over time in a gradual technical rollout.

Gas spikes on any chain when there is more demand than supply of blockspace. The HyperEVM uses the same gas system as Ethereum and many L2s, where there is a base fee and a priority fee: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1559.md

###

Can I send HYPE on the HyperEVM to a centralized exchange?

First confirm with the CEX that they support the HyperEVM. Note that the HyperEVM is one part of the Hyperliquid blockchain. HyperCore (e.g., perps, spot, and other trading features) and the HyperEVM are separate parts of the same blockchain. Some CEXs support sending and receiving HYPE from Spot balances on HyperCore, but not the HyperEVM. Always remember to do a test transaction when you are trying something for the first time.

How do I set up an RPC? What RPCs are available?

There is one rpc hosted at rpc.hyperliquid.xyz/evm

Other builders are launching their own as well. Users may run a node, but it is not a requirement to serve an RPC, as all data is uploaded real-time to S3. See python SDK for an example: https://github.com/hyperliquid-dex/hyperliquid-python-sdk/blob/master/examples/evm_block_indexer.py

How do I get gas on the HyperEVM?

The native token, HYPE, is the gas token on the HyperEVM. You can buy HYPE with USDC on Hyperliquid and then transfer from HyperCore to the HyperEVM. You can also use the bridges mentioned in [How do I bridge assets to the HyperEVM from another chain? ](/hyperliquid-docs/onboarding/how-to-use-the-hyperevm#how-do-i-bridge-assets-to-the-hyperevm-from-another-chain)

What is the difference between the HyperEVM and other EVMs, like Ethereum?

Functionality is largely the same, which makes it easy to build similar tooling and applications. The main differences are:

1. Dual block system: fast small blocks and slow big blocks

2. Interactions with the native side of the Hyperliquid state, providing a seamless onboarding for all Hyperliquid users to the HyperEVM

# Points

The points program began on November 1, 2023. 1,000,000 points were distributed weekly to users for 6 months, ending May 1, 2024. Points are meant to reward users who contribute to the protocol’s success.

Affiliates earned 1 point for every 4 points their referred users earned. Points criteria was updated on a recurring basis. Points distributions were based on weekly activity ending Wednesdays at 00:00 UTC. Distributions took place on Thursdays. Points were also distributed for the closed alpha period up through October 31, 2023.

The L1 phase of points began on May 29, 2024 and ended in November 2024. 700,000 points were distributed weekly. Activity from May 1-28, 2024 received a multiplier. Hyperliquid reserves the right to modify previous point distributions under its sole discretion.

# Proposal: Staking referral program

_At this time, there is no definitive implementation for the staking referral program ready for mainnet. Based on extensive user and builder feedback, it is being re-evaluated to ensure fairness for all builders and a healthy builder ecosystem._

Details for the original proposal for a staking referral program are below:

Builders and referrers who stake HYPE will be able to keep a percentage of their referred users’ trading fees, up to a maximum of 40% for builders and referrers at the highest staking tier. All builders and referrers with staked HYPE will automatically enjoy these benefits once the feature is enabled on mainnet.

Furthermore, builders and referrers will be able to share up to 50% of the staking referral revenue back to the referred user. This allows referrers to offer better than the default rates to new users.

urthermore, builders and referrers will be able to share up to 50% of the staking referral revenue back to the referred user. This allows referrers to offer better than the default rates to new users.
###

What are builder codes and referral codes?

Builder codes allow interfaces routing through Hyperliquid to charge a custom fee on a per-order basis. This additional fee is called a builder fee and goes 100% to the builder. The new staking referral program is strictly more revenue for builders.

Referral codes are applied when a user joins via a referral link. Unlike builder codes, referral codes are tied to users and apply regardless of how the user trades in perpetuity. Note that builder codes override referral codes for that order, and referral codes are disabled after the user trades $1B cumulative volume.

and apply regardless of how the user trades in perpetuity. Note that builder codes override referral codes for that order, and referral codes are disabled after the user trades $1B cumulative volume.
###

How it works

The staking referral program interacts with staking tier fee discounts and the VIP tier fee schedule. If a builder or referrer has a higher staking tier than their referred user on a trade, they keep up to 100% of the difference. The percentage kept by the builder or referrer decreases as the volume tier of the referred user increases, starting at 100% for VIP 0 and ending at 40% for VIP 6.

As an example: Alice has 100k staked HYPE, which gives a trading fee discount of 30%. Bob has 100 staked HYPE, which gives a trading fee discount of 10%, and Bob is at VIP 1. If Bob uses Alice’s builder or referral code, Alice can keep (30% - 10%) * 90% = 18% of the fees that Bob pays. Alice could share with Bob up to 9% of his fees. In other words, Bob could receive up to a 9% trading fee discount using Alice’s builder or referral code.

Market liquidity risk

As a relatively new protocol, there could be a potential risk of low liquidity, especially in the early stages. This can lead to significant price slippage for traders, negatively affecting the overall trading experience and possibly leading to substantial losses.

###

Oracle manipulation risk

Hyperliquid relies on price oracles maintained by the validators to supply market data. If an oracle is compromised or manipulated for an extended period of time, the mark price could be effected and liquidations could occur before the price reverts to its fair value.

supply market data. If an oracle is compromised or manipulated for an extended period of time, the mark price could be effected and liquidations could occur before the price reverts to its fair value.
###

Risk mitigation

There are additional measures in place to prevent oracle manipulation attacks on less liquid assets. One such restriction is open interest caps, which are based on a combination of liquidity, basis, and leverage in the system.

When an asset hits the open interest cap, no new positions can be opened. Furthermore, orders cannot rest further than 1% from the oracle price. HLP is exempt from these rules in order to continue quoting liquidity.

Note that this is not an exhaustive list of potential risks.

Important reminders

1. Never share your wallet, seed phrase, password, or private key with anyone or any website. If someone directly reaches out to you, assume they are a scammer.

2. There is no Hyperliquid app on any app store. Any app pretending to be the official Hyperliquid app is a scam. Do not download or interact with it.

3. Always check the full URL of any website you interact with. Scammers often use similar looking domains, e.g., “hyperliguid.xyz,” to prompt users to sign a malicious transaction.

# Auto-deleveraging

Auto-deleveraging strictly ensures that the platform stays solvent. If a user's account value or isolated position value becomes negative, the users on the opposite side of the position are ranked by unrealized pnl and leverage used. The specific sorting index to determine the affected users in profit is `(mark_price / entry_price) * (notional_position / account_value)`. Those traders' positions are closed at the previous mark price against the now underwater user, ensuring that the platform has no bad debt.

Auto-deleveraging is an important final safeguard on the solvency of the platform. There is a strict invariant that under all operations, a user who has no open positions will not socialize any losses of the platform.

# Builder codes

_Note: The term "builder" in the context of builder codes does not refer to block builders within consensus, but rather "defi builders" who build applications on Hyperliquid._

**Builder codes** allow builders to receive a fee on fills that they send on behalf of a user. They are set per-order for maximal flexibility. The user must approve a maximum builder fee for each builder, and can revoke permissions at any time. Builder codes are processed entirely onchain as part of the fee logic.

In order to use builder codes, the end user would first approve a max fee for the builder address via the `ApproveBuilderFee` action. This action must be signed by the user's main wallet, not an agent/API wallet. The builder must have at least 100 USDC in perps account value.

Builder codes currently only apply to fees that are collected in USDC, i.e. builder codes do not apply to the buying side of spot trades. Builder fees charged can be at most 0.1% on perps and 1% on spot.

Once the authorization is complete, future order actions sent on behalf of the user may include an optional builder parameter: `{"b": address, "f": number}`. `b` is the address of the builder and `f` is the builder fee to charge in tenths of basis points. I.e. a value of 10 means 1 basis point.

Builders can claim fees from builder codes through the usual referral reward claim process.

For example code see the Python SDK <https://github.com/hyperliquid-dex/hyperliquid-python-sdk/blob/master/examples/basic_builder_fee.py>[](https://github.com/hyperliquid-dex/hyperliquid-python-sdk/blob/master/examples/basic_builder_fee.py)

###

API for builders

The approved maximum builder fee for a user can be queried via an info request `{"type": "maxBuilderFee", "user": "0x...", "builder": "0x..."}.`

The total builder fees collected for a builder is part of the referral state response from info request `{"type": "referral", "user": "0x..."}`.

The trades that use a particular builder code are uploaded in compressed LZ4 format to `https://stats-data.hyperliquid.xyz/Mainnet/builder_fills/{builder_address}/{YYYYMMDD}.csv.lz4`e.g. `https://stats-data.hyperliquid.xyz/Mainnet/builder_fills/0x123.../20241031.csv.lz4`

# Contract specifications

Hyperliquid perpetuals are derivatives products without expiration date. Instead, they rely on funding payments to ensure convergence to the underlying spot price over time. See [Funding](/hyperliquid-docs/trading/funding) for more information.

Hyperliquid has one main style of margining for perpetual contracts: USDC margining, USDT denominated linear contracts. That is, the oracle price is denominated in USDT, but the collateral is USDC. This allows for the best combination of liquidity and accessibility. Note that no conversions with the USDC/USDT exchange rate are applied, so these contracts are technically quanto contracts where USDT pnl is denominated in USDC.

When the spot asset's primary source of liquidity is USDC denominated, the oracle price is denominated in USDC. Currently, the only USDC-denominated perpetual contracts are PURR-USD and HYPE-USD, where the most liquid spot oracle source is Hyperliquid spot.

Hyperliquid's contract specifications are simpler than most platforms. There are few contract-specific details and no address-specific restrictions.

Hyperliquid DEX, entry price, unrealized pnl, and closed pnl are purely frontend components provided for user convenience. The fundamental accounting is based on margin (balance for spot) and trades.
###

Perps

Perp trades are considered `opening` when the absolute value of the position increases. In other words, longing when already long or shorting when already short.

For opening trades, the entry price is updated to an average of current entry price and trade price weighted by size.

For closing trades, the entry price is kept the same.

Unrealized pnl is defined as `side * (mark_price - entry_price) * position_size` where `side = 1` for a long position and `side = -1` for a short position

Closed pnl is `fee + side * (mark_price - entry_price) * position_size `for a closing trade and only the fee for an opening trade.

`side = 1` for a long position and `side = -1` for a short position

Closed pnl is `fee + side * (mark_price - entry_price) * position_size `for a closing trade and only the fee for an opening trade.
###

Spot

Spot trades use the same formulas as perps with the following modifications: Spot trades are considered `opening` for buys and `closing` for sells. Transfers are treated as buys or sells at mark price, and genesis distributions are treated as having entry price at `10000 USDC` market cap. Note that while 0 is the correct answer as genesis distributions are not bought, it leads to undefined return on equity.

Pre-existing spot balances are assigned an entry price equal to the first trade or send after the feature was enabled around July 3 08:00 UTC.

# Fees

Fees are based on your rolling 14 day volume and are assessed at the end of each day in UTC. Sub-account volume counts toward the master account and all sub-accounts share the same fee tier. Vault volume is treated separately from the master account. Referral rewards apply for a user's first $1B in volume and referral discounts apply for a user's first $25M in volume.

Maker rebates are paid out continuously on each trade directly to the trading wallet. Users can claim referral rewards from the Referrals page.

There are separate fee schedules for perps vs spot. Perps and spot volume will be counted together to determine your fee tier, and spot volume will count double toward your fee tier. i.e., `(14d weighted volume) = (14d perps volume) + 2 * (14d spot volume)`

and spot volume will be counted together to determine your fee tier, and spot volume will count double toward your fee tier. i.e., `(14d weighted volume) = (14d perps volume) + 2 * (14d spot volume)`

On most other protocols, the team or insiders are the main beneficiaries of fees. On Hyperliquid, fees are entirely directed to the community (HLP, the assistance fund, and spot deployers). Spot deployers may choose to keep up to 50% of trading fees generated by their token. For security, the assistance fund holds a majority of its assets in HYPE, which is the most liquid native asset on the Hyperliquid L1. The assistance fund uses the system address `0xfefefefefefefefefefefefefefefefefefefefe` which operates entirely onchain as part of the L1 execution. The assistance fund requires validator quorum to use in special situations.

###

Staking linking

A "staking user" and a "trading user" can be linked so that the staking user's HYPE staked can be attributed to the trading user's fees. A few important points to note:

* The staking user will be able to unilaterally control the trading user. In particular, linking to a specific staking user essentially gives them full control of funds in the trading account.

* Linking is permanent. Unlinking is not supported.

* The staking user will not receive any staking-related fee discount after being linked.

* Linking requires the trading user to send an action first, and then the staking user to finalize the link. See "Link Staking" at app.hyperliquid.xyz/portfolio for details.

* No action is required if you plan to trade and stake from the same address.

Overview

Funding rates for crypto perpetual contracts are a mechanism that is used to ensure the price of the contract stays close to the underlying asset's price.

The funding rate is a periodic fee that is paid by one side of the contract (either long or short) to the other side. Funding is purely peer-to-peer and no fees are collected on the payments.

The rate is calculated based on the difference between the contract's price and the spot price of the underlying asset. For consistency with CEXs, interest rate component is predetermined at 0.01% every 8 hours, which is 0.00125% every hour, or 11.6% APR paid to short. This represents the difference in cost to borrow USD versus spot crypto.

The premium component fluctuates based on the difference between the perpetual contract's price and the underlying spot oracle price. If the contract's price is higher than the oracle price, the premium and hence the funding rate will be positive, and the long position will pay the short position. Conversely, if the contract's price is lower than the spot price, the funding rate will be negative, and the short position will pay the long position.

The funding rate on Hyperliquid is paid every hour. The funding rate is added or subtracted from the balance the contract holders at the funding interval.

Funding rates are designed to prevent large price disparities between the perpetual contract and the underlying asset. When the funding rate is high, it can incentivize traders to take the opposite position and help to bring the contract's price closer to the spot price of the underlying asset.

###

Technical details

Funding on Hyperliquid is designed to closely match the process used by centralized perpetual exchanges.

The funding rate formula applies to 8 hour funding rate. However, funding is paid every hour at one eighth of the computed rate for each hour.

The specific formula is `Funding Rate (F) = Average Premium Index (P) + clamp (interest rate - Premium Index (P), -0.0005, 0.0005)`. The premium is sampled every 5 seconds and averaged over the hour.

As described in the [clearinghouse](/hyperliquid-docs/hypercore/clearinghouse) section, the oracle prices are computed by each validator as the weighted median of CEX spot prices for each asset, with weights depending on the liquidity of the CEX.

`premium = impact_price_difference / oracle_price`

where

`impact_price_difference = max(impact_bid_px - oracle_px, 0) - max(oracle_px - impact_ask_px, 0)`

and `impact_bid_px` and `impact_ask_px` are the average execution prices to trade`impact_notional_usd` on the bid and ask sides, respectively. See the contract specifications for the impact notional used, as well as other contract specific parameters.

Funding on Hyperliquid is capped at 4%/hour. Note that this is much less aggressive capping than CEX counterparts. The funding cap and funding interval do not depend on the asset.

Note that the funding payment at the end of the interval is `position_size * oracle_price * funding_rate`. In particular, the spot oracle price is used to convert the position size to notional value, _not the mark price._

payment at the end of the interval is `position_size * oracle_price * funding_rate`. In particular, the spot oracle price is used to convert the position size to notional value, _not the mark price._
###

Numerical Example

Here is an explicit example computation:

1. The interest rate is 0.01% (fixed).

2. The perpetual contract is trading at a premium, with the impact bid price being $10,100, and the spot price at $10,000.

3. The premium index is calculated as the difference between the two prices, which is $100 in this case.

4. The funding interval is 1 hour.

5. You hold a long position of 10 contracts, each representing 1 BTC.

First, calculate the premium:

Premium = (Impact bid price - Spot Price) / Spot Price = ($10,100 - $10,000) / $10,000 Premium = 0.01 (or 1%)

Next, clamp the interest rate minus the premium rate at 0.05%:

Clamped Difference = min(max(Interest Rate - Premium Rate, -0.05%), 0.05%)

Clamped Difference = min(max(0.01% - 1%, -0.05%), 0.05%)

Clamped Difference = min(max(-0.99%, -0.05%), 0.05%) Clamped Difference = -0.05%

Now, calculate the funding rate:

Funding Rate = Premium Rate + Clamped Difference Funding Rate = 1% + (-0.05%)

Funding Rate = 0.95%

High level summary

_Hyperps_ (Hyperliquid-only perps) trade like perpetual contracts that users are familiar with, but do not require an underlying spot or index oracle price. Instead, the funding rate is determined relative to a moving average hyperp mark price in place of the usual spot price. This makes the hyperp price more stable and less susceptible to manipulation, unlike usual pre-launch futures.

This new derivative design does not require an underlying asset or index that exists at all points of the hyperp's lifetime, only that the underlying asset or index eventually exists for settlement or conversion.

When trading hyperps, funding rates are very important to consider. If there is heavy price momentum in one direction, funding will heavily incentivize positions in the opposite direction for the next eight hours. As always, be sure to understand the contract before trading.

###

Hyperp mechanism details

Hyperps work just like normal perpetual contracts, except the external spot/index oracle price is replaced with an 8 hour exponentially weighted moving average of the last day's minutely mark prices.

Precisely, `oracle_price(t) = min[sum_{i=0}^1439 [(t - i minutes < t_list ? initial_mark_price : mark_price(t - i minutes)) * exp(-i/480)] * (1 - exp(-1/480)) / (1 - exp(-3)), intial_mark_price * 4]`

Here `a ? b : c` evaluates to `b` if `a` is true and otherwise `c.`

Samples are taken on the first block after each unix minute, but the timestamps used are the nearest exact minute multiples. When there are fewer than 480 mark price samples, the initial mark price is used as the padding value.

Funding rate premium samples are computed as 1% of the usual clamped interest rate and premium formula. See Funding docs for more details.

The mark price of Hyperps incorporate the weighted median of pre-launch perp prices from CEXs as a component in the usual mark price formula. Despite the often significantly different contract specifications between hyperps and other venues' pre-launch perp markets, they are nonetheless included as mark price inputs to provide greater mark price stability during volatility.

Note that the oracle price is also restricted to be at most 4 times the one month average mark price as an additional safeguard against manipulation.

###

Overview

A liquidation event occurs when a trader's positions move against them to the point where the account equity falls below the maintenance margin. The maintenance margin is half of the initial margin at max leverage, which varies from 3-40x. In other words, the maintenance margin is between 1.25% (for 40x max leverage assets) and 16.7% (for 3x max leverage assets) depending on the asset.

When the account equity drops below maintenance margin, the positions are first attempted to be entirely closed by sending market orders to the book. The orders are for the full size of the position, and may be fully or partially closed. If the positions are entirely or partially closed such that the maintenance margin requirements are met, any remaining collateral remains with the trader.

If the account equity drops below 2/3 of the maintenance margin without successful liquidation through the book, a backstop liquidation happens through the liquidator vault. See Liquidator Vault explanation below for more details.

When a cross position is backstop liquidated, the trader's cross positions and cross margin are all transferred to the liquidator. In particular, if the trader has no isolated positions, the trader ends up with zero account equity.

When an isolated position is backstop liquidated, that isolated position and isolated margin are transferred to the liquidator. The user's cross margin and positions are untouched.

During backstop liquidation, the maintenance margin is not returned to the user. This is because the liquidator vault requires a buffer to make sure backstop liquidations are profitable on average. In order to avoid losing the maintenance margin, traders can place stop loss orders or exit the positions before the mark price reaches the liquidation price.

p liquidations are profitable on average. In order to avoid losing the maintenance margin, traders can place stop loss orders or exit the positions before the mark price reaches the liquidation price.
Liquidations use the mark price, which combines external CEX prices with Hyperliquid's book state. This makes liquidations more robust than using a single instantaneous book price. During times of high volatility or on highly leveraged positions, mark price may be significantly different from book price. It is recommended to use the exact formula for precise monitoring of liquidations.

times of high volatility or on highly leveraged positions, mark price may be significantly different from book price. It is recommended to use the exact formula for precise monitoring of liquidations.
###

Motivation

As described above, the majority of liquidations on Hyperliquid are sent directly to the order book. This allows all users to compete for the liquidation flow, and allows the liquidated user to keep any remaining margin. Unlike CEXs there is no clearance fee on liquidations.

The resulting system is transparent and prioritizes retaining as much capital as possible for the liquidated user.

The resulting system is transparent and prioritizes retaining as much capital as possible for the liquidated user.
###

Partial Liquidations

For liquidatable positions larger than 100k USDC (10k USDC on testnet for easier testing), only 20% of the position will be sent as a market liquidation order to the book. After a block where any position of a user is partially liquidated, there is a cooldown period of 30 seconds. During this cooldown period, all market liquidation orders for that user will be for the entire position.

###

Liquidator Vault

Backstop liquidations on Hyperliquid are democratized through the liquidator vault, which is a component strategy of HLP. Positions that are below 2/3 of the maintenance margin can be taken over by the liquidator vault.

On average, backstop liquidations are profitable for the liquidator. On most venues, this profit goes to the exchange operator or privileged market makers who internalize the flow. On Hyperliquid, the pnl stream from liquidations go entirely to the community through HLP.

###

Computing Liquidation Price

When entering a trade, an estimated liquidation price is shown. This estimation may be inaccurate compared to the position's estimated liquidation price due to changing liquidity on the book.

Once a position is opened, a liquidation price is shown. This price has the certainty of the entry price, but still may not be the actual liquidation price due to funding payments or changes in unrealized pnl in other positions (for cross margin positions).

The actual liquidation price is independent on the leverage set for cross margin positions. A cross margin position at lower leverage simply uses more collateral.

The liquidation price does depend on leverage set for isolated margin positions, because the amount of isolated margin allocated depends on the initial margin set.

When there is insufficient margin to make the trade, the liquidation price estimate assumes that the account is topped up to the initial margin requirement.

The precise formula for the liquidation price of a position is

`liq_price = price - side * margin_available / position_size / (1 - l * side)`

where

`l = 1 / MAINTENANCE_LEVERAGE` . For assets with margin tiers, maintenance leverage depends on the unique margin tier corresponding to the position value at the liquidation price.

`side = 1 for long and -1 for short`

`margin_available (cross) = account_value - maintenance_margin_required`

`margin_available (isolated) = isolated_margin - maintenance_margin_required`

# Margin tiers

Like most centralized exchanges, the tiered leverage formula on Hyperliquid is as follows:

`maintenance_margin = notional_position_value * maintenance_margin_rate - maintenance_deduction`

On Hyperliquid, `maintenance_margin_rate` and `maintenance_deduction` depend only on the margin tiers, not the asset.

`maintenance_margin_rate(tier = n) = (Initial Margin Rate at Maximum leverage at tier n) / 2` . For example, at 20x max leverage, `maintenance_margin_rate = 2.5%`.

Maintenance deduction is defined at each tier to account for the different maintenance margin rates used at previous tiers:

`maintenance_deduction(tier = 0) = 0`

`maintenance_deduction(tier = n) = maintenance_deduction(tier = n - 1) + notional_position_lower_bound(tier = n) * (maintenance_margin_rate(tier = n) - maintenance_margin_rate(tier = n - 1))` for `n > 0`

In other words, maintenance deduction is defined so that new positions opened at each tier increase maintenance margin at `maintenance_margin_rate` , while having the total maintenance margin be a continuous function of position size.

Margin tables have unique IDs and the tiers can be found in the `meta` Info response. For IDs less than 50, there is a single tier with max leverage equal to the ID.

Margin computations follow similar formulas to major centralized derivatives exchanges.

# Margining

Margin computations follow similar formulas to major centralized derivatives exchanges.
###

Margin Mode

When opening a position, a margin mode is selected. _Cross margin_ is the default, which allows for maximal capital efficiency by sharing collateral between all other cross margin positions. _Isolated margin_ is also supported, which allows an asset's collateral to be constrained to that asset. Liquidations in that asset do not affect other isolated positions or cross positions. Similarly, cross liquidations or other isolated liquidations do not affect the original isolated position.

asset. Liquidations in that asset do not affect other isolated positions or cross positions. Similarly, cross liquidations or other isolated liquidations do not affect the original isolated position.
###

Initial Margin and Leverage

Leverage can be set by a user to any integer between 1 and the max leverage. Max leverage depends on the asset.

The margin required to open a position is `position_size * mark_price / leverage`. The initial margin is used by the position and cannot be withdrawn for cross margin positions. Isolated positions support adding and removing margin after opening the position. Unrealized pnl for cross margin positions will automatically be available as initial margin for new positions, while isolated positions will apply unrealized pnl as additional margin for the open position. The leverage of an existing position can be increased without closing the position. Leverage is only checked upon opening a position. Afterwards, the user is responsible for monitoring the leverage usage to avoid liquidation. Possible actions to take on positions with negative unrealized pnl include partially or fully closing the position, adding margin (if isolated), and depositing USDC (if cross).

###

Unrealized PNL and transfer margin requirements

Unrealized pnl can be withdrawn from isolated positions or cross account, but only if the remaining margin is at least 10% of the total notional position value of all open positions. The margin remaining must also meet the initial margin requirement, i.e. `transfer_margin_required = max(initial_margin_required, 0.1 * total_position_value)`

Here, "transferring" includes any action that removes margin from a position, other than trading. Examples include withdrawals, transfer to spot wallet, and isolated margin transfers.

Here, "transferring" includes any action that removes margin from a position, other than trading. Examples include withdrawals, transfer to spot wallet, and isolated margin transfers.
###

Maintenance Margin and Liquidations

Cross positions are liquidated when the account value (including unrealized pnl) is less than the _maintenance margin_ times the total open notional position. The maintenance margin is currently set to half of the initial margin at max leverage.

Isolated positions are liquidated by the same maintenance margin logic, but the only inputs to the computation are the isolated margin and the notional value of the isolated position.

Max Drawdown

The max drawdown on the portfolio page is only used on the frontend for users' convenience. It does not affect any margining or computations on Hyperliquid. Users who care about the precise formula can get their account value and pnl history and compute it however they choose.

The formula used on the frontend is the maximum over times `end > start` of the value `(pnl(end) - pnl(start)) / account_value(start)`

Note that the denominator is account value and the numerator is pnl. Also note that this not equal to absolute max drawdown divided by some account value. Each possible time range considered uses its own denominator.

Order types:

* Market: An order that executes immediately at the current market price

* Limit: An order that executes at the selected limit price or better

* Stop Market: A market order that is activated when the price reaches the selected stop price. Stop orders are generally used to help limit losses and lock in profits

* Stop Limit: A limit order that is activated when the price reaches the selected stop price

* Scale: Multiple limit orders in a set price range

* TWAP: A large order divided into smaller suborders and executed in 30 second intervals. TWAP suborders have a maximum slippage of 3%

###

TWAP details:

During execution, a TWAP order attempts to meet an execution target which is defined as the elapsed time divided by the total time times the total size. A suborder is sent every 30 seconds during the course of the TWAP.

A suborder is constrained to have a max slippage of 3%. When suborders do not fully fill because of market conditions (e.g., wide spread, low liquidity, etc.), the TWAP may fall behind its execution target. In this case, the TWAP will try to catch up to this execution target during later suborders. These later suborders will be larger but subject to the constraint of 3 times the normal suborder size (defined as total TWAP size divided by number of suborders). It is possible that if too many suborders did not fill then the TWAP order may not fully catch up to the total size by the end. Like normal market orders, TWAP suborders do not fill during the post-only period of a network upgrade.

###

Order options:

* Reduce Only: An order that reduces a current position as opposed to opening a new position in the opposite direction

* Good Til Cancel (GTC): An order that rests on the order book until it is filled or canceled

* Post Only (ALO): An order that is added to the order book but doesn’t execute immediately. It is only executed as a resting order

* Immediate or Cancel (IOC): An order that will be canceled if it is not immediately filled

* Take Profit: An order that triggers when the Take Profit (TP) price is reached.

* Stop Loss: An order that triggers when the Stop Loss (SL) price is reached

* TP and SL orders are often used by traders to set targets and protect profits or minimize losses on positions. TP and SL are automatically market orders. You can set a limit price and configure the amount of the position to have a TP or SL

# Perpetual assets

Hyperliquid currently supports trading of 100+ assets. Assets are added according to community input. Ultimately Hyperliquid will feature a decentralized and permissionless listing process.

Max leverage varies by asset, ranging from 3x to 40x. Maintenance margin is half of the initial margin at max leverage. E.g., if max leverage is 20x, the maintenance margin is 2.5%.

The portfolio page shows account value and P&L graphs on 24 hour, 7 day, and 30 day time horizons.

`Account value` includes unrealized pnl from cross and isolated margin positions, as well as vault balances.

Pnl is defined as `account value` plus net deposits, i.e. `account value + deposits - withdrawals`.

Note that these graphs are samples on deposits and withdrawals and also every 15 minutes. Therefore, they are not recommended to precise accounting purposes, as the interpolation between samples may not reflect the actual change in unrealized pnl in between two consecutive samples.

# Robust price indices

Hyperliquid makes use of several robust prices based on order book and external data to minimize risk of market manipulation.

_Oracle price_ is used to compute funding rates. This weighted median of CEX prices is robust because it does not depend on hyperliquid's market data at all. Oracle prices are updated by the validators approximately once every three seconds.

_Mark price_ is the median of the following prices:

1. Oracle price plus a 150 second exponential moving average (EMA) of the difference between Hyperliquid's mid price and the oracle price

2. The median of best bid, best ask, last trade on Hyperliquid

3. Median of Binance, OKX, Bybit, Gate IO, MEXC perp mid prices with weights 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, respectively

If exactly two out of the three inputs above exist, the 30 second EMA of the median of best bid, best ask, and last trade on Hyperliquid is also added to the median inputs.

Mark price is an unbiased and robust estimate of the fair perp price, and is used for margining, liquidations, triggering TP/SL, and computing unrealized pnl. Mark price is updated whenever validators publish new oracle prices. Therefore, mark and oracle price are updated approximately once every 3 seconds.

The EMA update formula is defined as follows for an update value of `sample` at duration `t` since the last update

`ema = numerator / denominator`

`numerator -> numerator * exp(-t / 2.5 minutes) + sample * t `

`denominator -> denominator * exp(-t / 2.5 minutes) + t`

Trades between the same address cancel the resting order instead of causing a fill. No fees are deducted, nor does the the cancel show up in the trade feed.

On CEXs this behavior is often labeled as "expire maker." This is a commonly preferred behavior for market making algorithms, where the aggressing order would like to continue getting fills against liquidity behind the maker order up until the limit price.

TP/SL orders close your position when a certain profit (resp. loss) has realized on your position.

The [mark price](/hyperliquid-docs/trading/robust-price-indices) is used to trigger TP/SL orders.

TP/SL orders can be dragged on the TradingView chart. Note that dragging in a way that causes the order to immediately execute will lead to an error. Usually this prevents user mistakes, but if this is your desired behavior you can manually close the order from the position table or order form.

###

Limit vs Market TP/SL orders

Users can choose between TP/SL market and limit orders. TP/SL market orders have a slippage tolerance of 10%.

By setting the limit price on TP/SL orders, users can control the slippage tolerance of a triggered order. The more aggressive the limit price, the more likely the TP/SL order will be filled upon triggering, but the higher the potential slippage upon filling.

As a concrete example, a SL order to close a long with trigger price $10 and limit price $10 will hit the book when the mark price drops below $10. If the price drops from $11 to $9 instantly it is quite likely this SL order would rest at $10 instead of filling. However, if the limit price were $8 instead of $10, it's likely to fill at some price between $9 and $8.

###

TP/SL associated with a position

TP/SL opened from the position form will have a size equal to the entire position by default. These orders will attempt to close the entire position at the time of trigger. If a specific size is configured on these TP/SL orders, they will be fixed-sized (i.e. they will not resize with the position after being placed).

Position TP/SL orders are the most beginner-friendly because they have simple placement and cancelation criteria.

Position TP/SL orders are the most beginner-friendly because they have simple placement and cancelation criteria.
###

TP/SL associated with a parent order (a.k.a one-cancels-other, OCO)

This style of TP/SL is more complicated. Please read the below carefully to avoid unexpected outcomes.

TP/SL opened from the order form have a fixed size equal to the order they are tied to.

If the parent order is fully filled at placement, the children TP and/or SL orders are immediately placed. This behavior is similar to the TP/SL assocated with a position.

When the parent order is not fully filled, the children orders enter an untriggered state. The TP/SL orders have not been placed, and upon cancelation of an unfilled parent order, the child TP/SL orders will be canceled.

If the trader cancels a partially filled parent order, _**the child TP/SL orders are fully canceled as well**_. If the trader desires a TP/SL for the partially filled size, they must do so manually, e.g. by placing a separate TP/SL orders associated with the new position.

However, if the parent order is partially filled and then canceled due to insufficient margin, the TP/SL orders will be placed as if the order were fully filled.

In conclusion, _**children TP/SL orders associated with a parent order will be placed if and only if the parent order fully fills or is partially filled followed by a cancelation for insufficient margin**_.

###

Overview

Validators play a critical role in maintaining the integrity and efficiency of Hyperliquid. The Hyper Foundation Delegation Program is designed to:

* Enhance network security by delegating tokens to reliable and high-performing validators.

* Promote diversity across the validator network to enhance decentralization.

* Support validators committed to the growth and stability of the Hyperliquid ecosystem.

Testnet performance will be a criterion for mainnet delegation, particularly when mainnet performance metrics are not available for a given validator. Delegations will be monitored on an ongoing basis. The Foundation reserves the right to cease delegation at any time.

The Foundation validators will strongly consider participation in the Delegation Program as a factor for trusting peer validators. Those interested in running a mainnet validator are highly encouraged to apply for the Delegation Program before setting up a mainnet validator.

Not much happening onchain this weekend, so here’s a small tip that some of you might already know, but isn’t widely used

You can give a wallet a name by assigning it an alias. Just click Update and name the wallet, it makes tracking wallets much easier without relying on external tools

To export or download your aliases, go to:
About (top left) → Export / Import your aliases → show - export

Make sure to do this so you don’t lose your aliases if you accidentally clear your cache

Also, go back through this channel and add aliases for every person or entity I’ve posted about, so you can easily keep track of them yourselves (alpha)

Four hours ago, the UNIT deployer address transferred their Solana and Fartcoin on Hypercore to a new address. According to their website, which was updated three hours ago, this appears to be the Solana Treasury address on Hyperliquid. The docs now also include a Solana Treasury address. It looks like they tested deposits and withdrawals between Hypercore and Solana, including both SOL and Fartcoin. With a mainnet upgrade scheduled today between 3 AM and 4 AM UTC, I expect spot SOL/Fartcoin to go live very soon

I saw lots of posts on the timeline about Abraxas Capital buying ETH. It’s not a directional bet but part of their Elysium Global Arbitrage Fund, which they are known for, meaning the position is market neutral

So why am I saying this? Because they’re using Hyperliquid to hedge a part of the holdings

They deposited $104.9M to Hyperliquid over the last 5 days and shorted $350M notional of ETH, BTC, and SOL

Michael novogratz, the CEO of Galaxy Digital (galaxy.com), just shilled Hyperliquid on CNBC

With some movements around their public wallets, I think these 2 are related to them. I am not sure if it's them holding the HYPE or if the HYPE was sold OTC/being custodied for a HNWI or another entity, however, Michael said they are holding Hype in their portfolio

They received a total of 1.6M ($42.5M) on this address from KuCoin/Gate:
https://hypurrscan.io/address/0x8e489d045f2130c9e98426e1d5d2d229753f93ab

Which they transferred to these 2 addresses:
785K HYPE ($20.9M)
https://hypurrscan.io/address/0xcac19662ec88d23fa1c81ac0e8570b0cf2ff26b3

820K HYPE ($21.9M) which is staked

Wintermute staked 91K HYPE ($1.15M) 25 hours ago in preparation for the upcoming staking tiers, bringing their total staked HYPE to 101K ($1.27M).

At the same time, they also transferred 100K HYPE to Gate and 150K HYPE to KuCoin.

Currently, they hold 828K spot HYPE ($10.4M) while being short 934K HYPE ($11.7M) on perps, effectively hedging both their spot and staked HYPE positions while farming the high funding fees

He transferred $6M of the profits to spot, of which he presumably is buying HYPE, already buying a total of 22K HYPE ($750K)

Last night, $Launchcoin dumped 40% in a matter of hours, causing many people to get liquidated, including one guy who got liquidated for $1M

https://hypurrscan.io/address/0x321aEA6Ac3A508bc9d4e8d2daf04988Ab1F87812

This led HLP to take over a $2M Launchcoin position, earning $500K in the last 24 hours and pushing the APR up to 18%

Lots of drama today on CT because of Teeznutz11 getting hacked and this tweet: x

The hack is real, and he managed to save like $485K worth of assets, including $430K worth of HYPE

He turned 3 wallets holding a total of 13K HYPE (~$430K) into a multisig supported by Hyperliquid itself to prevent the hacker from transferring the HYPE out of the compromised wallets after the unstaking period ends

https://hypurrscan.io/address/0x04722123cc98c8a78f4d2851d2b363561af99edf

https://hypurrscan.io/address/0x2aa863b196f766ef15d20907627f3f8dfc40f874

https://hypurrscan.io/address/0x69e7d5b032fde8d1204ba1041ce08ccb8740c700

He also managed to save another $55K in various assets, including some NFTs, HYPE, and ETH

https://etherscan.io/address/0xc0AB94d2700Acfe312D8Dbb2395dee7135EAE0cF

If your wallet ever gets compromised while you have HYPE staked, immediately move your wallet into a multisig wallet controlled by newly created addresses from a fresh seed, on a new, uncompromised device. If you act faster than the hackers, you may still be able to recover your staked HYPE on Core after the unstaking period ends

This vault operated by Keisan has now made $700K for its depositors by longing HYPE & BTC and shorting what Keisan calls 'garbage altcoins.' If you had deposited money on the first day of the vault’s launch, you would have doubled your money, with minimal drawdowns along the way

It became the second-largest vault on Hyperliquid, after Sifu's vault, in which Sifu holds over 99% of the TVL

Ventuals (a platform for trading startups before they go public) is currently testing on Hyperliquid testnet

They have launched their own perp DEX called Venone on HIP-3, with OAI (OpenAI) as the only trading asset

They are also testing VUSDC (Ventuals USDC), which can be viewed on Purrsec, though it's unclear to me if this is serious or just a experiment

They now hold 1,351,564 HYPE bought at an average price of $35.05, totaling $47.36M.

It's now worth $55.7M, meaning they're up more than $8.3M at current prices.

31 hours earlier, the same wallet also withdrew 42K HYPE ($1.84M) from Gate.io

4 weeks ago, Felix's front end was compromised, with the exploit totaling 40k ($1.68M) HYPE. (No protocol smart contracts were compromised, just an isolated front end attack). This same person (who got compromised) just finished TWAP selling 111K HYPE ($5.05M) on a new wallet.

Since this post, Anchorage Digital has deposited 22.5M USDC to Hyperliquid across five wallets and has bought 118K HYPE (~$5.4M) so far.

They still have 17.1M USDC left on Hyperliquid, likely to be used to buy more HYPE

Hyperliquids' USDC TVL grew by 28% last week, from $3.6B to $4.6B,  the same amount it reached over its first 20 months and 20 days.

In the same period, UNITS' TVL also increased by 29.5%, rising from $440M to $570M.

This brings the total TVL to nearly $5.2B, marking the first time it has surpassed $5B.

Smartestmoney is currently the top holder of kHYPE (Kinetiq), holding 2.07M kHYPE ($97.7M).

He also holds 3M HYPE ($141.6M) on Core, all of which is staked, and 110K HYPE ($5.2M) in Valantis/Hyperlend.

This means he has deposited 41% of his total 5.18M HYPE ($245M) into Kinetiq.

This happened last week, what are the chances it was in preparation to sell that HYPE? Around 1M HYPE was sent back to KuCoin after this, which then funded Eyenovia with 60K HYPE. The remaining 940K HYPE was transferred back to FalconX/KuCoin cold wallets.

However, there’s still 1.06M HYPE sitting on Gate.io, which is strange. I think it’s currently being sold - though it’s unclear if that’s happening directly on Gate (due to low liquidity/scam cex) or through another route. This could explain the underperformance. No hard evidence yet, but it does make sense if you think about it.

Does anyone have any takes on this? Could this be a plausible explanation for what's going on or was it normal wallet management?

Update: They use Kucoin/Gate to hide their onchain transactions in wallets, and FalconX can't trade directly on Hyperliquid directly for compliance/operational reasons. We cant know if it was being sold.

Kinetiq now has over 10M kHYPE (~$468M) in TVL, with 3,120 holders - meaning the average holder has liquid staked around 3,200 HYPE.

More than 1% of all HYPE (and 3.3% of the circulating supply) has been liquid staked on Kinetiq in under three days.

I don’t know who’s been selling all the time - which is weird - but I do know this wallet sold 189K HYPE ($8.5M) three hours ago in just eight minutes, causing the price to drop by 2.5%.

They had bought the HYPE eight days earlier at the same price.

Wallets linked to Pantera Capital transferred 252K HYPE ($11M) to a new wallet, which likely belongs to Nonco, a digital assets firm. The funds were then transferred to HyperEVM

Of that, 100K HYPE ($4.4M) was sent to KuCoin, 41K HYPE ($1.8M) went to what appear to be NONCO wallets, and 111K HYPE ($4.9M) remains idle on the EVM wallet

Machibigbrother almost fully closed his PUMP long by closing approximately 4.1B PUMP ($11.5M) within 45 minutes, 6 hours ago, which pushed the price down by 9%.

He still holds a long of about 390M PUMP ($1.1M).

During the same period, he also reduced a small part of his HYPE long, closing around 140K HYPE (~$5.2M).

He is now down $23M since his PnL all-time high on July 22nd and is nearly breakeven on the account, which is still up $3.2M all-time

Abraxas capital is holding a total of $300M USDC on Hyperliquid (6.3% of TVL) and have around $1.2B in shorts, which accounts for almost 9% of Hyperliquid’s total OI. This is part of their Elysium Global Arbitrage Fund, meaning the positions are FULLY market-neutral.

The stake whale sold almost all his HYPE and rotated back into ETH, selling in clips of 5K–11K HYPE and incurring 0.5%–1.5% slippage, which moved the price visibly.

In total, he sold 149K HYPE ($6.9M), rotated it into 2,250 ETH ($10.1M), and withdrew everything to Stake.com.

He still holds 30K HYPE ($1.4M) in his account.

Amidst the market drop, this wallet was partially liquidated for 486 BTC ($54.3M) and 6,840 ETH ($31.6M), with its open longs still worth over $100M combined on 42x leverage.

He is still long 600 BTC ($67M) and 10K ETH ($45.9M), with liquidation just 2% below the current price.

Overall, he has done almost $5 billion in volume and lost nearly $5M in all-time PnL.

Inga_no started selling relatively small amounts of HYPE ($1M) over the last 3 days, and went short roughly $60M on BTC, ETH, and XRP

He’s still holding 1.7M HYPE (~$32M)

This person is currently the largest individual wallet farming on HyperEVM

He supplied 1.7M WHYPE ($31M) to Felix and deposited $11.5M into their FEUSD stability pool, which he borrowed against the 1.7M WHYPE he supplied

About 50 minutes ago, when Hyperlend raised its caps, he instantly supplied 390K HYPE (worth $7.4M)

Not sure what’s happening on Gate, looks like they transferred almost all their HYPE from their hot wallet to other wallets last night, leaving just 100k HYPE ($1.75M) in the hot wallet. They moved out 2.4M HYPE worth $43 million

Could be them switching to new infra, transferring to cold wallets, or something else, not sure, and pretty weird behavior

https://hypurrscan.io/address/0x0d0707963952f2fba59dd06f2b425ace40b492fe

UPDATE: Looks like there’s $1.3M HYPE (~$23M) sitting in a Gate deposit address that received the funds from KuCoin
