# Running a validator

GitHub repository for detailed instructions on how to run a non-validator and validator: <https://github.com/hyperliquid-dex/node>[](https://github.com/hyperliquid-dex/node)

Running validating and non-validating nodes is permissionless, meaning anyone can choose to do so. The active set of validators is determined transparently based on the top twenty-one by stake.
