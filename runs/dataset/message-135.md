Four hours ago, the UNIT deployer address transferred their Solana and Fartcoin on Hypercore to a new address. According to their website, which was updated three hours ago, this appears to be the Solana Treasury address on Hyperliquid. The docs now also include a Solana Treasury address. It looks like they tested deposits and withdrawals between Hypercore and Solana, including both SOL and Fartcoin. With a mainnet upgrade scheduled today between 3 AM and 4 AM UTC, I expect spot SOL/Fartcoin to go live very soon
