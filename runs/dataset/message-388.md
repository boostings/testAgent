A wallet presumed to be linked to Justin Sun deposited $5M USDC to Hyperliquid and began TWAPing into 110K HYPE (~$5.4M).

Before the TWAP began, the wallet was already holding 623K HYPE (
~$30.4M), all of which is currently supplied to Hyperlend. Against this HYPE, he has borrowed approximately $2.6M in stablecoins.
