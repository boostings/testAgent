Wallets linked to Pantera Capital transferred 252K HYPE ($11M) to a new wallet, which likely belongs to Nonco, a digital assets firm. The funds were then transferred to HyperEVM

Of that, 100K HYPE ($4.4M) was sent to KuCoin, 41K HYPE ($1.8M) went to what appear to be NONCO wallets, and 111K HYPE ($4.9M) remains idle on the EVM wallet
