# Protocol vaults

Hyperliquidity Provider (HLP) is a protocol vault that does market making and liquidations and receives a portion of trading fees. 

HLP democratizes strategies typically reserved for privileged parties on other exchanges. The community can provide liquidity for the vault and share its pnl. HLP is fully community-owned.

The deposit lock-up period is 4 days. This means you can withdraw 4 days after your most recent deposit. E.g., if you deposited on Sep 14 at 08:00, you would be able to withdraw on Sep 18 at 08:00.
