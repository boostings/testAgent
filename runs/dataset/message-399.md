This happened last week, what are the chances it was in preparation to sell that HYPE? Around 1M HYPE was sent back to KuCoin after this, which then funded Eyenovia with 60K HYPE. The remaining 940K HYPE was transferred back to FalconX/KuCoin cold wallets.

However, there’s still 1.06M HYPE sitting on Gate.io, which is strange. I think it’s currently being sold - though it’s unclear if that’s happening directly on Gate (due to low liquidity/scam cex) or through another route. This could explain the underperformance. No hard evidence yet, but it does make sense if you think about it.

Does anyone have any takes on this? Could this be a plausible explanation for what's going on or was it normal wallet management?

Update: They use Kucoin/Gate to hide their onchain transactions in wallets, and FalconX can't trade directly on Hyperliquid directly for compliance/operational reasons. We cant know if it was being sold.
