Lots of drama today on CT because of Teeznutz11 getting hacked and this tweet: x

The hack is real, and he managed to save like $485K worth of assets, including $430K worth of HYPE

He turned 3 wallets holding a total of 13K HYPE (~$430K) into a multisig supported by Hyperliquid itself to prevent the hacker from transferring the HYPE out of the compromised wallets after the unstaking period ends

He also managed to save another $55K in various assets, including some NFTs, HYPE, and ETH

If your wallet ever gets compromised while you have HYPE staked, immediately move your wallet into a multisig wallet controlled by newly created addresses from a fresh seed, on a new, uncompromised device. If you act faster than the hackers, you may still be able to recover your staked HYPE on Core after the unstaking period ends
