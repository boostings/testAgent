Documentation for the Hyperliquid public API

You can also use the API via the Hyperliquid Python SDK: <https://github.com/hyperliquid-dex/hyperliquid-python-sdk>[](https://github.com/hyperliquid-dex/hyperliquid-python-sdk)

There is also a Rust SDK (although it is less maintained): <https://github.com/hyperliquid-dex/hyperliquid-rust-sdk>[](https://github.com/hyperliquid-dex/hyperliquid-rust-sdk)

There are also Typescript SDKs written by members of the community: <https://github.com/nktkas/hyperliquid>[](https://github.com/nktkas/hyperliquid) <https://github.com/nomeida/hyperliquid>[](https://github.com/nomeida/hyperliquid)

CCXT also maintains integrations in multiple languages that conforms with the standard CCXT API: <https://docs.ccxt.com/#/exchanges/hyperliquid>[](https://docs.ccxt.com/#/exchanges/hyperliquid)

All example API calls use the Mainnet url (https://api.hyperliquid.xyz), but you can make the same requests against Testnet using the corresponding url (https://api.hyperliquid-testnet.xyz)
