# Delegation program

### 

Overview

Validators play a critical role in maintaining the integrity and efficiency of Hyperliquid. The Hyper Foundation Delegation Program is designed to: 

  * Enhance network security by delegating tokens to reliable and high-performing validators.

  * Promote diversity across the validator network to enhance decentralization.

  * Support validators committed to the growth and stability of the Hyperliquid ecosystem.

Testnet performance will be a criterion for mainnet delegation, particularly when mainnet performance metrics are not available for a given validator. Delegations will be monitored on an ongoing basis. The Foundation reserves the right to cease delegation at any time.

The Foundation validators will strongly consider participation in the Delegation Program as a factor for trusting peer validators. Those interested in running a mainnet validator are highly encouraged to apply for the Delegation Program before setting up a mainnet validator.

### 

Eligibility

  * You must have 10k HYPE in one address before applying. The minimum self-delegation amount is 10k HYPE. Note that the minimum self-delegation amount is locked for one year.

  * You must run at least two non-validator nodes with 95% uptime if your application is accepted. The IP addresses of these nodes will be shared publicly and attributed to you on documentation pages. Others will use your non-validators as seed nodes to connect to. The IP addresses must be static, e.g. using elastic IP addresses on AWS. Important: Do not open any non-validator ports to the public until an announcement to open up mainnet non-validators. Never open validator ports to the public.

  * You must comply with applicable laws and regulations. 

  * You must successfully complete KYC/KYB processes. 

  * You must not be from a restricted jurisdiction, which includes, but is not limited to, Ontario, the U.S., Cuba, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Syria, and certain Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine. 

  * The Foundation reserves the right to adjust the above eligibility criteria at any time.

### 

Apply

  * Fill out the [application form](https://forms.gle/Mheitp58BkjU1qK8A).

  * Following review of your application, you may be invited to provide KYC/KYB details.

  * If your application is accepted and KYC/KYB is completed, you will need to review and accept the Program Terms.
