Important reminders

  1. Never share your wallet, seed phrase, password, or private key with anyone or any website. If someone directly reaches out to you, assume they are a scammer.

  2. There is no Hyperliquid app on any app store. Any app pretending to be the official Hyperliquid app is a scam. Do not download or interact with it.

  3. Always check the full URL of any website you interact with. Scammers often use similar looking domains, e.g., “hyperliguid.xyz,” to prompt users to sign a malicious transaction.

    1. The official Hyper Foundation website is <https://hyperfoundation.org/>[](https://hyperfoundation.org/)

    2. You can trade on <https://app.hyperliquid.xyz/trade>[](https://app.hyperliquid.xyz/trade), in addition to other frontend websites 

    3. The official X (Twitter) accounts are <https://x.com/HyperliquidX>[](https://x.com/HyperliquidX) and <https://x.com/HyperFND>[](https://x.com/HyperFND)

    4. The official Telegram announcements channel is <https://t.me/hyperliquid_announcements>[](https://t.me/hyperliquid_announcements)
