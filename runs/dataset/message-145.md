I saw lots of posts on the timeline about Abraxas Capital buying ETH. It’s not a directional bet but part of their Elysium Global Arbitrage Fund, which they are known for, meaning the position is market neutral

So why am I saying this? Because they’re using Hyperliquid to hedge a part of the holdings

They deposited $104.9M to Hyperliquid over the last 5 days and shorted $350M notional of ETH, BTC, and SOL
