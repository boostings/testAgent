# Perpetual assets

Hyperliquid currently supports trading of 100+ assets. Assets are added according to community input. Ultimately Hyperliquid will feature a decentralized and permissionless listing process. 

Max leverage varies by asset, ranging from 3x to 40x. Maintenance margin is half of the initial margin at max leverage. E.g., if max leverage is 20x, the maintenance margin is 2.5%.
