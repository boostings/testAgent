The stake whale sold almost all his HYPE and rotated back into ETH, selling in clips of 5K–11K HYPE and incurring 0.5%–1.5% slippage, which moved the price visibly. 

In total, he sold 149K HYPE ($6.9M), rotated it into 2,250 ETH ($10.1M), and withdrew everything to Stake.com. 

He still holds 30K HYPE ($1.4M) in his account.
