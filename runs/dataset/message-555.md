Abraxas Capital just transferred 410K HYPE ($18.5M) to HyperEVM and liquid-staked the entire amount on Kinetiq.

They then bought 25.6K PT-kHYPE ($1.1M) and are now holding 146.5K PT-kHYPE ($6.5M), after buying 120.9K PT-kHYPE ($5.4M) over the past four days.

This activity is part of their Elysium Global Arbitrage Fund and is entirely delta-neutral.
