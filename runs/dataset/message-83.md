Not sure what’s happening on Gate, looks like they transferred almost all their HYPE from their hot wallet to other wallets last night, leaving just 100k HYPE ($1.75M) in the hot wallet. They moved out 2.4M HYPE worth $43 million

Could be them switching to new infra, transferring to cold wallets, or something else, not sure, and pretty weird behavior

UPDATE: Looks like there’s $1.3M HYPE (~$23M) sitting in a Gate deposit address that received the funds from KuCoin
