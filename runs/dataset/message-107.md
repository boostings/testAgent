Not much happening onchain this weekend, so here’s a small tip that some of you might already know, but isn’t widely used

You can give a wallet a name by assigning it an alias. Just click Update and name the wallet, it makes tracking wallets much easier without relying on external tools

To export or download your aliases, go to:
About (top left) → Export / Import your aliases → show - export

Make sure to do this so you don’t lose your aliases if you accidentally clear your cache

Also, go back through this channel and add aliases for every person or entity I’ve posted about, so you can easily keep track of them yourselves (alpha)
