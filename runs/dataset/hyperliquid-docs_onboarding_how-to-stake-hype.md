You can use different websites to stake HYPE on HyperCore, including: 

  * <https://app.hyperliquid.xyz/staking/>[](https://app.hyperliquid.xyz/staking/)

  * <https://stake.nansen.ai/stake/hyperliquid>[](https://stake.nansen.ai/stake/hyperliquid)

  1. You will need HYPE in your Spot Balance on HyperCore. If you have HYPE on the HyperEVM, you would need to [transfer it from the HyperEVM](https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/onboarding/how-to-use-the-hyperevm#how-do-i-move-assets-to-and-from-the-hyperevm) to HyperCore.

  2. Transfer HYPE from your Spot Balance to your Staking Balance.

  1. Choose a validator to stake to. Staking to a validator has a 1 day lockup. 

To unstake, follow the same process in reverse

  1. Unstake from a validator.

  2. Transfer from your Staking Balance to your Spot Balance. This takes 7 days. 

  3. After 7 days, the HYPE will appear in your Spot Balance.
