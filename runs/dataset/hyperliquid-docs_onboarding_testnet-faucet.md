# Testnet faucet

To use the testnet faucet, you need to have deposited on mainnet with the same address. You can then claim 1,000 mock USDC from the testnet faucet: <https://app.hyperliquid-testnet.xyz/drip>[](https://app.hyperliquid-testnet.xyz/drip)

If you are using an email login, Privy generates a different wallet address for mainnet and testnet. You can [Export your email wallet](/hyperliquid-docs/onboarding/export-your-email-wallet) from mainnet, import it into a wallet extension (e.g., [Rabby](https://support.rabby.io/hc/en-us/articles/11477459275279-How-to-migrate-from-other-wallets-to-Rabby-Wallet) or Metamask), and connect it to testnet.
