Hyperliquids' USDC TVL grew by 28% last week, from $3.6B to $4.6B,  the same amount it reached over its first 20 months and 20 days. 

In the same period, UNITS' TVL also increased by 29.5%, rising from $440M to $570M. 

This brings the total TVL to nearly $5.2B, marking the first time it has surpassed $5B.
