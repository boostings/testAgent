# Vaults

Vaults are a powerful and flexible primitive built into HyperCore. Strategies running on vaults benefit from the same advanced features as the DEX, from liquidations of overleveraged accounts to high throughput market making strategies. No more depositing into vaults that simply rebalance two tokens. 

Anyone can deposit into a vault to earn a share of the profits. In exchange, the vault owner receives 10% of the total profits. (Note that protocol vaults do not have any fees or profit share). Vaults can be managed by an individual trader or automated by a market maker. All strategies come with their own risk, and users should carefully assess the risks and performance history of a vault before depositing.
