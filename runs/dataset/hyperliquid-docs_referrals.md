### 

How do I refer someone to Hyperliquid?

You can create a referral code on <https://app.hyperliquid.xyz/referrals>[](https://app.hyperliquid.xyz/referrals) after you’ve done $10,000 in volume. You will receive 10% of referred users' fees, less any fee discount they receive. Referral rewards apply for a user's first $1B in volume and referral discounts apply for a user's first $25M in volume. 

Share your referral code with other traders using a unique link: app.hyperliquid.xyz/join/YOURCODE. 

### 

How do I use a referral code?

Enter a referral code on <https://app.hyperliquid.xyz/referrals>[](https://app.hyperliquid.xyz/referrals) or use a friend's referral link. Using a referral code will give you a 4% discount on your fees for your first $25M in volume. Referral discounts do not apply to vaults or sub-accounts because those are treated as independent accounts in the clearinghouse.
