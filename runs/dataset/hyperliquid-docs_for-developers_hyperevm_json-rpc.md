Unsupported requests

  * Requests that require historical state are not supported at this time on the default RPC implementation. However, independent archive node implementations are available for use, and the GitHub repository has examples on how to get started indexing historical data locally. Note that read precompiles are only recorded for the calls actually made on each block. Hypothetical read precompile results could be obtained from a full L1 replay.

Rate limits: IP based rate limits are the same as the API server.
