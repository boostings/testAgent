Ventuals (a platform for trading startups before they go public) is currently testing on Hyperliquid testnet

They have launched their own perp DEX called Venone on HIP-3, with OAI (OpenAI) as the only trading asset

They are also testing VUSDC (Ventuals USDC), which can be viewed on Purrsec, though it's unclear to me if this is serious or just a experiment
