Michael novogratz, the CEO of Galaxy Digital (galaxy.com), just shilled Hyperliquid on CNBC

With some movements around their public wallets, I think these 2 are related to them. I am not sure if it's them holding the HYPE or if the HYPE was sold OTC/being custodied for a HNWI or another entity, however, Michael said they are holding Hype in their portfolio

They received a total of 1.6M ($42.5M) on this address from KuCoin/Gate:

Which they transferred to these 2 addresses:
785K HYPE ($20.9M)
https://hypurrscan.io/address/0xcac19662ec88d23fa1c81ac0e8570b0cf2ff26b3

820K HYPE ($21.9M) which is staked
